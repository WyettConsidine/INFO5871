Even as Russia remains under unprecedented Western economic sanctions, the U.S. finds itself dependent on one Russian vital import: enriched uranium. The U.S. is the largest producer of nuclear energy in the world, but it has allowed its civilian nuclear infrastructure to languish since Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagans presidencies in the 1970s and 1980s.While the U.S. has coasted on its laurels, with nuclear energy production not changing much in over 30 years, Russia continues its gradual climb upward and exports many reactors, while China is investing heavily in civilian nuclear tech and boosting its atomic power generation at home. Beijing plans to build 24 new nuclear power plants by 2030, bringing the total up to 60, overtaking the U.S. with its old reactor fleet. For comparison, the U.S. has 93 operational nuclear power plants in total, and in the same period as Chinas building spree, the U.S. added 2 with none under development now.This decline is by choice. The U.S. certainly used to have the technical and financial resources to compete with Russia and China in these fields, but the political will to pursue nuclear power (despite its overwhelmingly green characteristics (zero CO2 emissions, and its exemplary safety record in North America) has been lacking. The notorious Three Mile Island accident in 1979, killed, injured, irradiated, or harmed zero people. Meanwhile, ballooning costs and the nightmare that is Americas byzantine environmental review and permitting processes resulted in the last nuclear power plant arriving 7 years late and 17 billion dollars over budget. Its little surprise the U.S. is falling behind in many nuclear areas. A generation of Americans were scared by Three Mile Island, and the nuclear industry became a political and environmental target, said Jack Edlow of Edlow International, a company that specializes in the global transportation of nuclear materials and has been in the nuclear industry for 55 years.The average age of a nuclear reactor in the U.S. is 40 years old, meaning Russia and China have been able to take advantage of (often American) research into better reactors. The emerging technology of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and advanced generation four reactors are being embraced far quicker in China and Russia than in the U.S.SMRs are a popular option to advance clean and safe production, as they address multiple concerns about nuclear power. The ease of assembly and transport of SMRs changes the construction of a reactor from a multi-billion dollar, multi-year process into a shorter and cheaper endeavor with timelier returns. SMRs also lower environmental risks due to their anticipated reduced rate of accidents and lack of meltdown potential due to innovative technology. Additionally, environmental and aesthetic concerns are addressed by the ability of SMRs to be placed in remote areas, or underground. Despite the promise of SMRs and platitudes from the DOE on the subject, investments in SMRs lag far behind what is needed.Even with an updated fleet of reactors, the United States would still be falling behind Russia in its supply of high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU), which is enriched up to 20% compared to the average 5% of uranium used in current reactors to allow more efficient units to function. The commercial supply of HALEU is currently controlled by TENEX, a division of the state-owned Russian nuclear energy company Rosatom. To bolster Americas domestic production, the Biden administration has put out an RFP for HALEU enrichment. The process of building a domestic supply will be difficult to jumpstart with only one U.S. company, Centrus Energy, being licensed to refine HALEU and one European company, Urenco, planning to start production in New Mexico. The RFP will allow many companies other than CENTRUS to bid for the new plant operation but operation is not likely to occur until the late 2020s.Building a new reactor is uniquely difficult in the United States due to its own self-imposed bureaucratic straight jacket. It takes an average 3.2 years to generate an environmental impact statement (EIS) for a new reactor  that is generate, not process. There are then years of additional Nuclear Regulatory Commission hearings to officially license any project. None of these concern safety  safety inspections occur independently of this process and largely function as designed, lasting only months. Then, years of public hearings susceptible and often systematically captured by private interests and militant environmentalists further delays construction, forcing the U.S. to burn coal and natural gas instead of the clean atom.What was once introduced to prevent government planners from running roughshod over communities has become a tool of privileged interests to block construction. This over-regulation does not protect the environment and deters private investment in green energy.All these problems stem from a lack of political will. Thankfully, the U.S. does seem to be slowly entering into a new chapter and re-embracing nuclear power. The Biden administration, in its pursuit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030, has embraced nuclear energy with 6 billion dollars in aid going to the industry. This is not enough, as 62 billion dollars were allocated to renewables, especially solar and wind, but it is a good start. Congress needs to take a positive stand and vote on the requested funds to provide fuel development in the US. If it is serious, they need to act immediately.In December 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a motion to ban U.S. uranium imports from Russia even though we do not have the capacity within the US to meet our own demand. American companies are on the technical edge of nuclear power, such as NuScale Powers research into SMRs. Technology like that which NuScale proposes may be more expensive than anticipated, however, with significant price increases hindering the progress of planned projects.Decades of bipartisan policy failure will not be reversed with a deluge of legislation. A bipartisan consensus and presidential leadership are desperately needed for the vitally necessary American nuclear renaissance. To ensure the U.S. keeps its leading nuclear edge while maintaining its green energy ambitions, the U.S. needs to rediscover civilian nuclear power, support new generation of reactor designs, and streamline permitting and environmental review procedures. Unless it does so, no amount of laudable single-time subsidies will fix the decades -long morass that is U.S. nuclear energy. We need to launch the new era of Atoms for Peace, and the US must lead this effort concluded Jack Edlow. The time is now
The world is currently in the process of reevaluating its past rejection of nuclear power and is increasingly starting to view it as a reliable source of power that allows for greater energy security. This is at least in part due to the energy crisis that befell Europe after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, vindicating past worries that over-reliance on fossil fuels from autocratic regimes has made the Western countries vulnerable to political blackmail.It is now clear that Western use of natural gas and petroleum from aggressive dictatorshipswhich use cash flows from oil and gas sales to reinforce and expand their hold on powerhas backfired badly. In this context, the experience of Armeniaa small country that draws 40 percent of its energy from nuclear poweris instructive, showing how nuclear power can be instrumental in building societal reliance and political stability.Living in the dark cold. It is the winter of 19921993. As I climb the dark stairs in a freezing-cold Soviet apartment building in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia where my family and I live, the water from the two full buckets I carry is splashing down my legs and freezing on the stairs. My sister Shooshan and I, 14 and 15, are carrying water up to our 11th-floor apartment. The water to our apartment shut off weeks ago, and we get at most one hour of electricity each day. I estimate that we need exactly seven gallons of water, if we are careful, for our basic daily needs. So, we repeat the trip every day. During the precious hour when we do get electricity, my mother rushes to the kitchen to cook food for the next 24 hours. I run to the bakery, where I stand in a long queue to buy the half pound of bread that the state has rationed for each one of us.The daily routine, which goes on for the whole winter, is exhausting. But it is also empowering. As teenagers we feel that we are stronger than the disastrous conditions inflicted on us by the combination of the Soviet collapse, the Nagorno-Karabakh war, and the ensuing severe energy crisis.The reasons that my sister and Iand the thousands of other Armenian teenagers like ushad to lug water and plan their lives around the one hour of electricity during that cruel winter go back to the turbulent events that shook Armenia during the preceding decades.In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Unionwhich Armenia was part ofrapidly expanded its fleet of nuclear reactors to support its growing industrial energy needs. As a result, two pressurized water reactors (PWR) of the Soviet VVER-440 type were built in the Armenian town of Metsamor, about 30 kilometers west of Yerevan. Started in 1977 and 1980, respectively, the two reactors quickly covered more than half of the energy needs of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. (The remainder of the electricity was generated by Armenias hydroelectric stations and gas-fired power plants.) The Armenia of the 1980s was a tiny but prosperous Soviet republic that prided itself in a highly educated labor force, an array of scientific institutes, and a vibrant electronics industry that produced some of the early Soviet computer mainframe designs.Chernobyl. On April 26, 1986, one of the Soviet-designed, graphite-moderated RBMK reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant underwent a catastrophic power excursion that ripped the reactor open. The explosion and fire that followed propelled an enormous amount of radioactive matter into the open atmosphere leading to what is now known as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, with widespread radioactive contamination, hundreds of deaths from acute radiation poisoning, and likely thousands of additional deaths due to radiation-induced cancers in the months and years that followed.The Chernobyl accident resonated worldwide, dramatically undermining public trust in nuclear power as a safe source of energy. The public perception of danger from nuclear power was magnified by the outrageous lies that the Soviet leadership spread about the disaster, the obvious incompetence and irresponsibility of the Soviet nuclear designers who built and operated the Chernobyl reactor, and the poorly executed cleanup efforts which were compounded by miscalculations and gross mistakes.Overnight, citizens across the Soviet Union and beyond went from a blissful ignorance about radiation to an understandableyet irrationalfear of anything radiation-related. People in Armenia, despite living more than 2,000 kilometers away from Chernobyl, started perceiving radioactive threats everywhere, often attributing many of their common ailments to radiation. Physicists, like my parents, tried to explain what radiation is and how natural doses of radiation are not dangerous. But their advice was sometimes met with hostility: Werent the builders of Chernobyl also scientists?In one chilling conversation that I witnessed at a dinner party, one of the guests told my father only half in jest, You physicists you should all be shot! To paraphrase Valery Legasovs eponymous character from HBOs five-part mini-series Chernobyl: The danger of the lies is not that we mistake them for the truth, but that when enough lies are told we lose hope in the truth and start believing in stories. (Legasov was a Soviet chemist who actively worked on the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Concerned by the lack of nuclear safety in the Soviet nuclear industry, he died by suicide on April 27, 1988.)An earthquake, the Soviet collapse, and war. In December 1988, the devastating earthquake of Spitak killed 50,000 peoplea harrowing 2 percent of Armenias populationand destroyed most of the countrys infrastructure. The two VVER-440 reactors at Metsamor were suddenly in the public eye. Would another earthquake rip them open and turn Armenias heartland, where half of Armenias population lived, into a Chernobyl-like radioactive wasteland?To be clear, the PWRs at Metsamor are safer than the shoddily designed, graphite-moderated reactors at Chernobyl. Metsamors Soviet reactor design is close to the standard PWR designs that are still the most common reactor technology used in Western countries. And the buildings and the reactor structures were reinforced to account for Armenias seismic activity. But none of that mattered. After the Soviet governments grotesque lies about the Chernobyl disaster, the official assurances that the Metsamor reactors were safe did not convince many. Legasovs intuition was right: The pursuit for truth was replaced with belief in conspiratorial rumors. An environmentalist movement sprang up, calling for the shutdown of the Metsamor reactors. The authorities backed down, and the two reactors were turned off on February 25 and March 18, 1989.Shortly after the shutdown, the Soviet Union started to crack, finally collapsing in 1991. In neighboring Azerbaijan, an Armenian minority living in the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region, feeling marginalized and discriminated against, had long been fighting to protect their civil rights. With the weakening of Soviet power, the protest movement turned into demands for secession from Azerbaijan. The response in Azerbaijan was a series of brutal anti-Armenian pogroms in the cities of Sumgait and Baku that killed hundreds of Armenian civilians and forced about 300,000 others to flee the country. Fearing retaliation, the Azeri civilians living in Armenia fled en masse to Azerbaijan.A relatively peaceful political disagreement had suddenly turned into a violent conflict, with Azerbaijans pogroms against Armenians escalating to a total war against the Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh. As the Armenian government supported the Nagorno-Karabakh secessionists, Azerbaijan retaliated by shutting off some of the natural gas pipelines that led to Armenia. In a sense, Azerbaijans authorities did to Armenia what Russian President Vladimir Putin is now doing to Western European countries that support Ukraines war effort. With its nuclear reactors and natural gas supply shut down, Armenia was left with a reduced capacity to generate electricity.Then came the winter of 19921993. Mountain rivers froze, hydroelectric dams dried up, and suddenly hydropower too was nearly gone. Armenia was getting barely a trickle of electricity. What followed is a period now known in Armenia as tsurt u mut tariner, literally the cold and dark years: severe shortages of electricity, freezing concrete apartment complexes, closed schools, and many other disruptions. The economy collapsed, with Armenias gross domestic product contracting by an estimated 50 to 80 percent between 1990 and 1993. Then, a massive exodus followed, shrinking Armenias population by a quarter in just a few years.Nuclear power revival. The Armenian public quickly realized that, by abandoning nuclear power, it had forfeited the countrys energy independence. That vulnerability wasand still isvery effectively leveraged by its arch-enemy Azerbaijan. Was it too late to restore nuclear power?Understanding their mistake, the Armenian authorities re-evaluated their past decision. The choice was stark: Either indulge in exaggerated fears of radiation and face unpredictable consequences, or sober up and accept nuclear power as a lesser evil. Ultimately the government chose the sober option. But rather than rushing headfirst to hastily restart the Metsamor nuclear power plant, the authorities decided to make significant safety improvements to the reactors.One of the Metsamor reactors finally restarted on November 5, 1995, just before the winter season. The desperately needed 400 megawatts flowed again into the small countrys languishing power grid. Almost overnight, lights were turned on, water pumps worked again, and industries revved up to capacity. Children like my sister and I stopped their exhausting routine and Armenia became a net exporter of electricity.Over the 13 years that followed, Armenias economy grew by an unprecedented 700 percent. The difficult decision to restore nuclear power had saved Armenia and had put it on a path of development. In 2020, about 35 percent of electricity generated in Armenia came from nuclear, 25 percent came from renewables (primarily hydropower), and the remaining 40 percent from fossil fuels. (In 2021, the share of nuclear power temporarily dropped to 26 percent because the Metsamor reactor was shut down longer than usual to perform a thermal annealing of the pressure vessel, a maintenance method aimed at managing aging effects.)Despite its important contribution to the electricity mix, the nuclear power plant at Metsamor is not without problems. Mainly, like most Soviet-era PWRs, the reactor does not have the external containment building that is common with Western designs. It is also an aging machine. Because of Armenias growing energy needs, the Metsamor reactor has been issued multiple lifetime extensions. Based on current plans, Metsamors VVER-440 reactor will shut down permanently by 2036. Meanwhile the Armenian government has been busy exploring replacement alternatives, such as possibly US-built small modular reactors (SMRs), seen as a viable replacement. Armenian officials have also entered in discussions with Russia about the possibility of replacing the Soviet-era VVER-440 reactor with the much larger and more modern Russian VVER-1200 design. While the US option is not easymainly because of the lack of readiness of most SMR designsthe Russian option is particularly fraught. Armenia is reluctant to further increase its energy dependence on Russia, given Putins campaign of neo-Soviet expansionism. This is further exacerbated by the technical and economic difficulty of hosting a 1200-megawatt electric VVER-1200 unit on a grid that on average consumes only about 1,000 megawatts.Survival in the shadow of petro-dictatorship. In recent years, social scientists have studied the negative impacts of nuclear power on underprivileged communities, such as the effects of uranium mining on indigenous populations. These studies are important for understanding the social cost of this resource. However very rarely have scholars studied the positive impact that nuclear power has had in helping the victims of oppression.Most of the three million inhabitants in Armenia trace their lineage to the survivors of the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Most live near the border with the perpetrator state of Turkey, which to this day refuses to acknowledge its crime and in the recent past has actively helped Azerbaijan. Since 1993, Azerbaijan has been ruled by the Aliyev dynasty with an iron fist, strengthened by the cash flows from the export of the countrys large hydrocarbon reserves to Western countries. To further strengthen his hold on power, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev (son of Heydar Aliyev who held power in Azerbaijan for several decades) has tapped into Azerbaijanis trauma from the 1990s by demonizing Armenians and blaming all of Azerbaijans ill on this minority.Since he took power in 2003, the regime of Aliyev son has been accused of curtailing free speech and ethnic cleansing of Armenians, whereas Azerbaijans armed forces have been busy mounting a campaign of widespread cultural erasure. These decades of threats culminated in last September with a swift military attack on the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which in just one week brought the 3,000-year-old indigenous Armenian presence there effectively to an end. The situation currently is so severe that Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has warned that a new genocide may be underway.Armenians, whose newly budding democracy is under constant threat from the various authoritarian governments in the region, cannot achieve cultural and existential security if they do not have a state that ensures their security. And that includes energy security, to which nuclear power generation is key. Of course, Azerbaijan deserves to have a democratic government, too, something that is being hindered by the Western countries over-reliance on fossil fuel exports.The lessons of small nations. When it comes to understanding the value of nuclear energy, studies tend to focus on the big nuclear powers such as the United States, China, and Russia. They rarely study the experiences of small countries like Armenia. Still, the study of these insignificant players is important in terms of understanding the mistakes made, successes achieved, and lessons learned, which can be relevant for the big players as well. In a telling example, Germany is learning the hard way about the dangers of complacency when it comes to choosing between nuclear energy and fossil fuels for its energy mix: Over the last 20 years, German politicians preferred to shut down their scarybut nonetheless safenuclear power plants and increase their potentially destabilizingbut considered harmlessreliance on Russias natural gas. Had German policymakers studied Armenias experience of the 1990s, they could probably have avoided the energy crisis the country is currently experiencing.Sadly, its hard to tell whether European leaders have learned anything from Armenias struggle for energy security. In a now much-criticized statement from 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Azerbaijans dictator Ilham Aliyev a reliable partner. This gesture is now believed to have, at least partly, emboldened the Aliyev regimes brutality toward the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh. At least for now, it is as if Europe is merely switching dictators while maintaining the same dependence on fossil fuels.Only a full reckoning by Western countries of their over-reliance on fossil fuels can put an end to the authoritarian regimes that exist only because of their hydrocarbon exports. Such a reckoning, along with the development of renewable energy and nuclear power, would lead to net gains for the climate and the environment. It would also help strengthen liberal democracies that are being unprecedently threatened.The Bulletin elevates expert voices above the noise.

I would love to visit my parents home country some day, and tour our nuclear facilities as a partner and advocate myself.Thank you for the article, indeed those years without electricity had a huge negative impact not only economical but also social and psychological. I would like also to note a historical error in the article  Armenians were living in the Autonomous Oblast of Nagorno-Karabakh, there was no such thing as region.Thank you very much for this personal and national story. Its an important addition to what many people know, and some of us who teach should use it in any related courses (I certainly will). At the same time, your numbers for mortality and cancer incidence from the Chernobyl accident are much larger than those published by the Chernobyl Forum, the most detailed and long-term source of analyses. Their results are that around 50 radiation-related deaths occurred, with possibly up to 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer (98% survival rate, but still serious in many cases).

Betavolt Technology claims to have successfully miniaturized atomic energy batteries, which measure less than a coin at 15 x 15 x 5mm. The compact battery usesthe radioactive isotope Nickel 63 to generate 100 microwatts and a voltage of 3V of electricity through the process of radioactive decay.The battery is currently in the pilot testing stage and Betavolt plans to mass-produce them for commercial devices like phones and drones, but also states nuclear batteries could be used for aerospace equipment, AI, medical equipment, advanced sensors, and micro-robots. The Beijing-based company claims to have drawn inspiration from devices such as pacemakers, and satellites.Betavolt is planning to boost its tech to produce a 1-watt battery by 2025. And while it still has some way to go, the company seems confident stating development is way ahead of European and American scientific research institutions and enterprises.This technology could revolutionize electronics by removing the need for chargers or portable power banks altogether creating devices that run continuously and whose batteries do not degrade in terms of capacity and lifespan over charging cycles in the way Li-ion batteries do.It could even prove to be safer too, as Betavolt states that the BV100 will not catch fire or explode in response to punctures or even gunshots, unlike some current batteries that can be unsafe if damaged or when exposed to high temperatures.Currently nuclear batteries are used for spacecraft, underwater systems, automated scientific stations as well as crafts like the Mars rover, but they are large, heavy, and generate a lot of heat, as well as being expensive. However, Betavolt states that it uses a different approach.Betavolt claims the advantages of its atomic energy batteries are their lightweight, feature a long service life, as well as feature high energy density, and can work normally under extreme temperatures from -60 to 120-degrees Celcius.Understandably most people wouldnt want to carry nuclear material in their pocket; particular not viewers of HBO's fantastic but chilling Chernobyl series. Many could be hesitant to adopt the widespread use of nuclear batteries due to the negative connotations of nuclear tragedies like the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 or the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011.However, the Betavolt also addressed the concerns about radiation, stating the battery is safe as it has no external radiation and is suitable for use in medical devices inside the human body like pacemakers and cochlea implants.While it sounds like something from 1950s science fiction this technology could change the face of electronics by providing unwired, always-on devices that could be spell a new revolution in nuclear energy use.He is almost the textbook definition of a geek, who loves sci-fi, comics, games and of course, all things tech.

Nuclear energy was an unexpected winner at COP28, the United Nations global climate conference that recently concluded in the United Arab Emirates. More than 24 countries, including the United States, and 120 companies committed to tripling nuclear energy by 2050 as an essential part of mitigating climate change. The principal goal is carbon-free energy available 24/7 as an essential complement to variable wind and solar electricity. After years of skepticism, there is growing political momentum for nuclear energy, but if countries follow the current model of plant construction, they will not get where they have pledged to go. The world needs a new strategy for nuclear energy deployment that furthers climate goals, enhances grid reliability, and ensures that achieving energy security doesnt erode global security.To make good on the COP pledge, accounting for a ramp-up time, the world will soon need to build the equivalent of about 50 large nuclear power reactors per year until 2050. This is two-thirds more than were built at nuclear powers peak in the early 1980s, and the current pace of construction is well short of that.Seventeen countries are building just one or two reactors at a time, each sometimes taking over a decade to build. In the West, nuclear construction projects are often long, complex, and characterized by delays and cost over-runs. Regulatory uncertainty and long timelines discourage investment. China, Russia, South Korea, and now the UAE have demonstrated the ability to build new nuclear reactors effectively, but this alone is clearly insufficient. Newcomer nuclear countries like Poland, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines are looking to deploy domestically, but it will take time and considerable resources to meet simultaneously their project management, regulatory, security, finance and workforce ambitions.To succeed, nations must rethink how to build, regulate, and finance nuclear technology. The United States offers a case in point. The second of two new-build gigawatt-scale nuclear reactors in Georgia is showing the immense value of learning from experience, but there arent any other projects in the pipeline to take advantage of those lessons learned. The next US nuclear build will likely need to go back to basics without the benefits of an experienced workforce as technology evolves and schedules from commitment to operation extend well over a decade.A new system will need to deliver standardized products rather than costly and risky one-off multi-decade projects. This could mean relying on proven designs of gigawatt-scale reactors, or embracing a selection of new smaller designs amenable to assembly-line methods (analogous to those in the airline and shipbuilding industries), or some combination of both. Many countries, including the United States, have expressed strong interest in small modular reactors, but the reality is that little progress is being made.It will require groups of customers of zero-carbon always-available electricity  utilities, large industrial users, large IT companies  to agree to purchase electricity or heat from dozens of nuclear plants of the same design. This so-called orderbook approach, common in the aviation industry, would address many flaws of the current model by sending a durable demand signal to the nuclear supply chain, pooling resources, and unlocking workforce development, thereby reducing risks and costs. With each new reactor built, countries, companies, investors, and policy makers also learn more, saving time and money.Public-private partnerships will probably be needed to implement this vision. Governments can help motivate the parties by offering financial risk backstops that could provide further confidence to private-sector developers, lowering first-of-a-kind risks. But more may be needed to launch a true nuclear renaissance, since nuclear construction is capital intensive. Especially for countries launching new nuclear programs, multilateral banks such as the World Bank and European Investment Bank must rebuild their nuclear finance capabilities and provide necessary capital to support the formation of orderbook transactions; new multilateral facilities might be considered as well.In addition, the current process for certifying nuclear reactor designs is based on an inefficient country-by-country approach. Developing an international body charged with issuing a single globally accepted generic certification for reactor designs would further lower the barriers to nuclear deployment. Nuclear can look to the aviation industrys model, which certifies aircraft, subject to strict and uniform standards, across countries.Current geopolitical tensions in Europe and in the Middle East reinforce the importance of scaling up in a way that maintains strong nuclear nonproliferation and security standards. If greater energy security leads to more nuclear weapons, the nuclear energy enterprise will be compromised. Countries can meet these standards by tried and true practices of allowing international monitoring, relying on the international market for fuel rather than enriching their own, and avoiding weapons-usable materials as fuel. New approaches to transparency and verification can simultaneously alleviate concerns and free up unfettered international assistance.Countries dont need to wait to get started. The organization charged with ensuring the safe, secure, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is convening heads of state in Brussels in March to focus on expanding nuclear energy. This presents an important opportunity to begin putting the pieces of the plan outlined here in place. Countries should come ready to support the formation of orderbooks for specific nuclear reactor designs. Leaders should also lay the groundwork for enhanced regional and international institutions focusing on regulatory standardization, financial support, and workforce development.While each country will need to pursue its own individual pathway to nuclear energy, its essential the international community collectively reforms the system to enable success. Having recognized the need to expand nuclear energy, countries must now focus on cooperative implementation and work together to create the conditions for sustained scale-up of this important climate and energy security solution.Ernest J.

On a windy day last August, President Joe Biden signed a proclamation protecting the canyons, cliffs, and plateaus surrounding the Grand Canyon National Park, nearly a million acres abutting the Navajo Nation and Havasupai Indian Reservation.Biden said the new national monument was part of his commitment to Native peoples to protect their sacred lands. Preserving the Grand Canyon as a national park was used to deny Indigenous people full access to their homelands, Biden acknowledged.To Carletta Tilousi, one of the leaders of the Havasupai Tribe who have called the Grand Canyon home for more than 800 years, Bidens presence and his words felt momentous. Finally, the small voices of Indigenous people have been heard in the White House, she thought.But she knew the fight was not over. The monument prevented hundreds of mining claims, but two uranium mines were grandfathered in, in part due to an 1872 law that guaranteed their right to operate. And now, nearly 40 years after first gaining permission to extract uranium, a Colorado-based company is cashing in.The companys decision was influenced by favorable federal policies supporting nuclear energy, high prices for uranium ore, and greater demand for domestic nuclear fuel. The U.S. purchased 12 percent of its uranium from Russia in 2022, and theres growing political pressure to stop those imports in the face of Russias war against Ukraine.    The 17-acre Pinyon Plain Mine is 12 miles from the Grand Canyon, six miles from the Grand Canyon National Park, and four miles north of Red Butte, a site sacred to the Havasupai people where Biden gave his August address. The Havasupai Tribe sued along with environmental groups to prevent the mine from starting production, but lost its case in 2022.Energy Fuels plans to operate the mine for three years to six years and estimates that it will generate 2 million pounds of uranium, says Curtis Moore, senior vice president of marketing and corporate development.After mining operations are complete, the Pinyon Plain area will be fully reclaimed and returned to its natural state, the company has promised. There will be virtually no evidence a mine ever occupied the site.Amber Reimondo is doubtful. Shes energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the Grand Canyon and the Colorado Plateau that sued to prevent the mine along with the Havasupai Tribe, and says uranium mining threatens the aquifer in the greater Grand Canyon area.According to Reimondo, water systems in the landscape are complex and interconnected. Energy Fuels mining process involves drilling a mine shaft through shallow aquifers into uranium deposits, and water flows into the shaft, mixing with the ore, before being pumped out. The concern is that contaminated water will be mixed back into the groundwater.To date, the company has removed about 49 million gallons of water from the shaft, leaving it to evaporate in an aboveground pool or sharing it with local ranchers for their cattle once treated to EPA standards. Reimondo worries that water could eventually contaminate not only drinking water sources but the creeks and waterfalls throughout the Grand Canyon.Its really, really difficult for researchers to understand exactly what that risk is, because the region is so highly fractured and because we dont know exactly where water flows to and from, Reimondo said.Energy Fuels Curtis Moore thinks that concern is overblown. He said that the water that the company pumps out of the shaft is already highly concentrated in uranium because it has been in contact with the rocks long before their mining operations started.Their implication is that we are contaminating groundwater, which is simply false  its naturally not appropriate for human consumption, he said. He pointed to a 2022 permit from the state of Arizona that concluded the geology of the mine site like the slope of the land and type of rock are expected to prevent any potential impacts to groundwater resulting from mining operations.A separate 2021 study by scientists from the U.S. Geological Society found that the type of uranium mining conducted at Pinyon Plain Mine has historically had no confirmed effects on uranium levels in the groundwater sampled in and around the Grand Canyon. But the study also noted that it could take many years for any related pollution to reach the groundwater.That potential for negative long-term effects are what Havasupai Tribe members are concerned about. Dianna Uqualla, a Havasupai Tribal Council member, says if theres pollution in the aquifer years from now, she doubts anyone will take responsibility.Whos going to pay the price? she asked. Whos going to be the one to say, Yeah, I did it? I dont think anybodys going to do that. Theyre just going to say, Well, one less tribe, and were happy for that, is what the non-Natives will probably think.Uqualla is familiar with the long history of damage wrought by uranium mining on Native lands. In the nearby Navajo Nation, years of uranium mining caused lung cancer and a decadeslong struggle to get compensation. The mining was so widely harmful that the Navajo Nation has banned the transport of radioactive and related materials through their lands.Despite that ban, once mined, the uranium ore from Pinyon Plain Mine will be trucked to the White Mesa Mill in southern Utah along state and federal highways, including through Navajo Nation. Navajo President Buu Nygren has implored the federal government to step in on the matter.Once the ore makes it to White Mesa Mill, the company will extract natural uranium concentrate from the uranium ore, before selling the powder to U.S. nuclear power facilities, which arrange for the concentrate to be sent to other facilities for conversion and enrichment.Tilousi wishes that Congress would update the 1872 mining law that allowed Energy Fuels to continue operating a mine on a national monument. Thats something the Biden administration has recommended too, in part because the law allows companies to hold mining rights for long periods of time, which sows distrust among local communities including Indigenous peoples.Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

There is great potential for several new uranium production markets as the U.S. and Europe look to diversify away from Russia for new nuclear energy pursuits. The U.S. and several European countries have announced ambitious nuclear power plans for the coming decades, in support of a green transition. However, the lack of uranium production outside of Russia is posing a threat to achieving these plans. Sanctions introduced on Russian energy and other products, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, have led to global shortages of natural gas, uranium, and other critical materials. This has driven several state powers to diversify their supply chains and increase the regional production of a variety of energy sources and related materials. This means we could soon see new uranium-producing markets emerge in Europe and the U.S.While the U.S. and Europe imposed strict sanctions on the import of energy products, such as oil and gas, it was more difficult to do the same with uranium due to the lack of alternative supplies. The decrease in Russian uranium imports has led to delays in several nuclear power projects in the U.S., despite the governments ambitious nuclear project pipeline.Russia only mines5 percent of the global uranium supply domestically, while Russias Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation has several subsidiaries that mine uranium ore abroad, in countries such as Kazakhstan. Russia controls around 40 percent of the global processing facilities and 46 percent of the worlds total enrichment capacity. It is also way ahead of its competitors when it comes to producing innovative types of uranium, such as the high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) with a 15-19.75% share of enrichment, needed to power the latest generation of nuclear reactors.As Europe diversified away from Russian supplies of uranium,Kazakhstan became a major supplier, providing 26.82 percent of the EUs uranium in 2022. Kazakhstan has been steadily increasing its production capacity in recent years. Meanwhile, Niger provided 25.38 precent of the EUs supply, while Canada delivered 21.99 percent. However, Europe and the U.S. must develop their own uranium production capabilities if they want to avoid Russian-linked uranium production altogether, as well as ensure they remain competitive in the nuclear energy field.In December, the U.S. voted on abillprohibiting the import of Russian low-enriched uranium to the U.S. until 2040. This follows several stricter sanctions on Russian energy and recent innovations in the U.S. energy industry, such as increased LNG output and improved uranium production capabilities. In November, Centrus Energy Corpannouncedit had achieved the production of the first 20 kilograms ofhigh-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU)in the U.S. Part of the U.S. Department of Energys (DOE)HALEU Demonstration project, the project provided the first production of its kind in the country in over 70 years. The DOE hopes to achieve production at 16 advanced centrifuges at an enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio.Piketon is currently the only facility licensed to produce this type of uranium, but, if successful, the U.S. could establish other production sites. Centrus was two months ahead of schedule in delivering the first 20kg of HALEU. The companys President and CEO, Daniel B. Poneman,stated, This critical milestone is essential to meeting the Departments near-term HALEU needs while laying the groundwork for the full restoration of Americas lost domestic uranium enrichment capacity We are committed to working with the Department and industry to build a public-private partnership so that we can scale up production in the coming years to meet the full range of commercial and national security requirements for enriched uranium. Centrus hopes to boost its annual production of HALEU to 900km in 2024, and even higher in the future. The fuel will be used to power the initial cores of two demonstration reactors awarded under DOEsAdvanced Reactor Demonstration Programme.The U.K. is also developing a HALEU production programme. The U.K. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) recently announced plans to produce up to 24 GW of nuclear power by 2050. To achieve this feat, it will invest almost $12.7 million to develop the skills and site required to produce other advanced nuclear fuels in the country. The U.K. plans to use HALEU to power itsnext-generation reactors, which are expected to be up and running by the early 2030s. The DESNZ expects the funding to support the development of HALEU production capabilities in the northwest of England. Itstated, "This builds on the UK's work to displace Russia from the global nuclear fuels market, particularly in uranium conversion services, where government and industry are together investing up to 26 million to bring this capability back to the UK by the end of the decade.As the U.S. and Europe look to shift their nuclear dependency away from Russia by developing alternative supply chains and developing their uranium production capabilities, we can expect to see a rise in the number of uranium-producing markets around the world. This will support ambitious nuclear power plans across Europe and North America, as well as develop a more competitive global nuclear energy landscape.
While the surge in closures is significant, the Bank of France emphasized that the level remains below the average annual bankruptcy filings recorded between 2010 and 2019, which stood at 59,342. The pandemic years saw a considerably lower number of business closures, almost half of the figures reported in 2023. The report highlighted that the majority of closures in 2023 affected small and medium-sized enterprises. Businesses withless than 250 employees accounted for the vast majority, totaling 55,435 closures. Additionally, medium and large firms with over 250 employees experienced an increase in closures, with their numbers doubling from 2022 to reach 57. The negative trend was particularly prominent in the restaurant and hotel industry, where closures surged by 44.6 percent year-on-year. The information and communication technologies sector also saw a significant increase of 44.4 percent. In contrast, the country's agricultural sector recorded a 1.3 percent drop in the number of bankruptcy filings. A global perspective reported by the Financial Times in December indicated that corporate bankruptcies worldwide surpassed levels seen during the 2008 global financial crisis. Analysts attribute this surge to higher key interest rates and the self-liquidation of so-called "zombie firms," which survived theWuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) era primarily due to government support.French economic activity for 2023 very disappointing The Bank of France recently also reported that French economic activity in 2023 was disappointing. In its latest report published in late December, the French central bank lowered its growth forecast for the country's economy to just 0.8 percent for 2023. (Related: Desperate French government trying to convince tourists that it is safe to visit the country despite ongoing rioting.) The central bank also reports that France's gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 2023 only grew by a measly 0.1 percent, very narrowly avoiding a recessionand reversing the 0.1 percent contraction in GDP in the previous quarter. "[Economic] activity is resisting in the fourth quarter thanks to services," noted Bank of France Chief Economist Olivier Garnier. "The normalization trend in terms of price-setting behavior by companies is being confirmed month after month." Following the report on bankruptcies, recruitment remains a problem, with 45 percent of companies having problems filling vacancies. Despite the dismal economic reportscoming out of France, the country's central bank believes the economy will gradually recover in 2024, as it predicts inflation to drop from the annual average of 5.7 percent in 2023 to just 2.5 percent in 2024. Inflation will then continue to fall and by 2025 France is expected to drop to 1.8 percent, slightly below the European Central Bank's inflation target of two percent annually. The easing of price increases is expected to be combined with a rise in real wages, which the bank claims will provide French households with some breathing space as their purchasing power for 2024 increases by a projected 1.5 percent compared to last year's 0.7 percent increase. This could then fuel even more growth from 2025 onwards, which is when the negative effects of high interest rates are expected to fade and allow investment into France to pick up again after an expected 0.4 percent decrease in 2024. "In 2026, these trends should strengthen to generate a dynamic recovery," noted Garnier. Find more stories like this at Collapse.news.

In its latest report published in late December, the French central bank lowered its growth forecast for the country's economy to just 0.8 percent for 2023. (Related: Desperate French government trying to convince tourists that it is safe to visit the country despite ongoing rioting.) The central bank also reports that France's gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 2023 only grew by a measly 0.1 percent, very narrowly avoiding a recessionand reversing the 0.1 percent contraction in GDP in the previous quarter. "[Economic] activity is resisting in the fourth quarter thanks to services," noted Bank of France Chief Economist Olivier Garnier. "The normalization trend in terms of price-setting behavior by companies is being confirmed month after month." Following the report on bankruptcies, recruitment remains a problem, with 45 percent of companies having problems filling vacancies. Despite the dismal economic reportscoming out of France, the country's central bank believes the economy will gradually recover in 2024, as it predicts inflation to drop from the annual average of 5.7 percent in 2023 to just 2.5 percent in 2024. Inflation will then continue to fall and by 2025 France is expected to drop to 1.8 percent, slightly below the European Central Bank's inflation target of two percent annually. The easing of price increases is expected to be combined with a rise in real wages, which the bank claims will provide French households with some breathing space as their purchasing power for 2024 increases by a projected 1.5 percent compared to last year's 0.7 percent increase. This could then fuel even more growth from 2025 onwards, which is when the negative effects of high interest rates are expected to fade and allow investment into France to pick up again after an expected 0.4 percent decrease in 2024. "In 2026, these trends should strengthen to generate a dynamic recovery," noted Garnier. Find more stories like this at Collapse.news.

RICHLAND, Wash., Jan.  10, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Energy Northwest today announced an agreement with Bellevue-based Puget Sound Energy to accelerate the agencys program examining the feasibility of developing and deploying a next-generation nuclear energy facility. State policies requiring a substantial increase in clean electricity are leading utilities to evaluate potential sources of new clean energy generation; and nuclear energy possesses many of the key attributes vital to establishing a reliable, emissions-free electric grid. New nuclear energy technologies, such as advanced small modular reactors, are approaching commercial readiness and feature enhanced safety systems; simplified, standardized, and scalable designs; and the ability to both swiftly integrate with renewables and provide around-the-clock electricity  without producing any greenhouse gas emissions.The agreement, a $10 million investment by Puget Sound Energy in Energy Northwests new nuclear project feasibility phase, will guide future participation and investment decisions. This collaboration does not obligate Puget Sound Energy to any future financial commitment nor signify an ownership interest in a developed project.Energy Northwest is committed to developing clean energy resources capable of helping Washington state meet its climate and carbon reduction goals. As we de-carbonize the electric grid, it is increasingly evident new sources of carbon-free, reliable, and affordable electricity must be deployed  and advanced nuclear energy technology can play a vital role in this transition, said Bob Schuetz, Energy Northwest chief executive officer. Energy Northwests partnership with Puget Sound Energy underscores our shared commitment to address the climate challenge and meet the regions future clean energy needs with the help of new and innovative carbon-free nuclear energy technologies.Energy Northwest has been at the forefront of explorations into the viability of building a next generation nuclear energy plant in central Washington for several years. Such a facility could prove invaluable in meeting the states climate goals without jeopardizing the reliability and affordability of the electric grid.

BERKELEY, Calif., Jan.  22, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Todays news that President Biden will not resubmit former Commissioner Jeff Barans nomination to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission marks a watershed for efforts to modernize the NRC and for Congressional Democrats.America, the world, and the climate needs a nuclear regulator that takes the benefits of nuclear energy seriously. Nuclear energy protects public health, is a key technology for decarbonization and environmental conservation, and is a reliable and secure source of abundant electricity.Radiological safety is important. But current regulatory practice at the NRC sacrifices public health and safety in an endless effort to minimize exposure to low levels of radiological exposure that are so infinitesimal as to be unobservable epidemiologically.For over 70 years, nuclear energy has been an extraordinarily safe technology. Existing nuclear plants in the United States have saved over 600,000 Americans from premature death due to exposure to air pollution from conventional fossil fueled power plants. New nuclear technologies will be safer still and have the potential to save millions more lives all over the world. America and the world needs advanced nuclear technology to be commercialized as soon as possible.

The National Rally Against Reckless Renewables is on the first sitting day of Parliament, Tuesday, 6th February 2024, at 10am in front of Parliament House. This peaceful rally is grassroots, representing many diverse regional communities who are directly and adversely affected by the Australian Governments reckless rollout of renewables. We urge the Federal and State Governments to cease their reckless rollout of unreliable, unaffordable, and environmentally destructive wind, solar, limited firming batteries, and high-voltage transmission lines, amidst an ever-increasing demand for reliable electricity.Currently, there are over 1000 new renewable projects in the governments Powering Our Nation pipeline (Source AEMO, 2023). Almost all of these are located in Regional Australia. In the lead-up to most of these projects, this government has conducted short, insincere, and unacknowledged community consultation. Exploiting the fact that most of these projects are located in or near coastal, farming, and traditional communities with small populations, the government continues to disregard our concerns. In many cases, our right to judicial review or appeal has or will be removed.Australian consumers, taxpayers, and industries require an electricity network that is efficient, safe, reliable, secure, and affordable. It is critical for Australia, now and in the future, to establish a network that does not damage our unique environment, particularly productive agricultural land, fisheries, and native habitats.This governments reckless rollout of renewables poses a significant threat to our nation, threatening food production for Australians and 80 million consumers globally. Our fauna and flora are facing unprecedented destruction, as hundreds of thousands of hectares of land and ocean floors are being deforested and/or damaged. It is posing a threat to our economy, costing over $121 billion (AEMO, 2023). There are documented serious supply chain and sustainment issues, and therefore reliability risks, potentially leading to mass blackouts. Massive taxpayer subsidies and electricity bills will flow offshore for decades to the many greenwashed multinationals lined up for these subsidised investments.This rally is a coalition of grassroots community groups united under the National Rational Energy Network. We call upon the Australian Government to:1. Conduct an urgent Senate Inquiry: Establish a Senate Inquiry to scrutinise the technical veracity as well as the excessive economic, social and environmental costs of renewables, and the escalating risks to our national interest and security. This includes reviewing the committed, anticipated, actionable and future projects being fast-tracked by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water, in particular the Capacity Investment Scheme, Rewiring the Nation, Offshore Wind Projects, and expanding unelected overreaching organisations including the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, Climate Change Authority, Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Australian Energy Market Operator, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and Clean Energy Council.2. Suspend all renewable energy projects: We call on the Australian Government to convene the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council and request all states and territories suspend wind, solar, hydro and associated transmission construction until the above Senate Inquiry reports.3. Lift the ban on nuclear power: Nuclear energy has the lowest overall greenhouse gas emissions of any energy source as a result of its low land footprint, low material usage, and low waste output. The current ban is archaic, restraining Australia from achieving a strong reliable energy future.This is a national grassroots call for a responsible and sustainable approach to our energy future. We urge the Australian government to prioritise the well- being of our environment, communities, and the future of our nation.[10.00am Mr Grant Piper] [10.10am Ms Gemma Pride] [10.20am Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price] [10.30am Mr Craig Kelly] [10.40am Senator Ralph Babet] [10.50am Senator Ross Cadell] [11.00am Hon Barnaby Joyce MP] [11.10am The Hon Dr David Gillespie MP] [11.20 Senator the Hon.

Aboriginals speaking about desecration of sacred land during the building wind turbines are about as welcome in Aussie mainstream media as black power people supporting Trump are in the US mainstream media.Jacinta Price is one of Australias star politicians. She and her mother Bess Price (and families) are from Alice Springs and deserve high-praise for standing resolutely on principles that have nothing to do with race.No Bill, Jacinta is an evil Alt White and does not correctly represent the traditional owners who have had 100,000 years of perfect harmony on this continent which clearly involved sustainable farming in large permanent towns and had nothing to do with killing off all the megafauna and/or burning down so much of the forests that the rainfall patterns changed. Clearly.Did we get the Completely Unrelated Third Party Who No One Has Heard Of Before Or Invited that can march up in neo 1930s Euro cosplay and decisively prove to the MSM that the entire rally was funded by. (gasp) the Alt Right!! ?5- 30 meters deep) sea sponge. (A meaning from a limited sampled area a small part part of, NOT the whole Caribbean. My beach collected sponge spicules are all shallow origin.) Down where we already know thermocline temperatures are affected by ocean currents. And where we also know sea sponge spicule chemistry is at best a sketchy proxy for temperature alonewhich is why previously sea sponges almost never were used before as a temp proxy. Not even by Mann, Marcott, or Pages2.Novel but sketchy narrow geographic proxy extrapolated to usual alarmist global result. Very climate sciency. Alarmists are now probably scraping the bottom of their rotten climate science Apple barrel.The net zero agenda is so farcical it might be prudent to bring along a troop of clowns, comedians and cartoonists who are best able to explain and depict the logic of the government programs for net zero.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to. I said whoever is head of that organisation will make themselves a target, that a brush fire is the hardest kind of fire to fight, because there is no single place our opponents can focus to put it out.Naturally theyre getting the silent treatment from mainstream media, or when mentioned are dismissed as cranks and extremists, but their demands are actually quite moderate. For example, though some are totally against renewables, many of the participants are OK with powerlines being built, but they want them built underground, where they wont bother anyone.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to. I said whoever is head of that organisation will make themselves a target, that a brush fire is the hardest kind of fire to fight, because there is no single place our opponents can focus to put it out.BTW Nick, why do you h@te poor people so much as to want to feather your crony friends nests with grant money for settled science and money to the Chinese and European solar and wind bird chopper manufacturers.Nick Stokes shared a photo of the rally when it had barely begun. Well Im a part of that grass roots movement and trust me it has grown substantially over the past five years to well over a hundred different groups. What people forget is that Australia is a huge continent with a relatively small population so we are never going to be able to hold rallies like those in Europe. They are geographically small countries with large populations.There were attendees from parts of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia which means they travelled there by plane most likely. Those from within NSW would still have had many hours of driving to get to Canberra as well as one or two nights accommodation. My point is that to attend the rally was costly and took valuable time out of a farmers work schedule. We were impressed with the attendance of the people who put in so much valuable time, effort and personal expense to get the attention of the politicians on their first day back in parliament.Getup, which is along the same lines as the Antifa dress up crowd, tried to intimidate us with a flood of messages stating that they would effectively take over the rally with their presence and were asking their supporters for $12 donations towards signs that would outnumber ours at the rally. No one turned up! Then they had the gall to put out a message that theyd basically shut us down. All lies! We experienced none of the opposition we had expected.We had amazing support from politicians speaking up for us as well as farmers and others from the regions who spoke really well. Peter Ridd spoke too, a name that you would all be familiar with. The government now know that there is considerable opposition to their renewables plan. And as we are many groups united it will not be easy for them to shut us down.
Lithium polymer batteries have had quite the impact on many portable devices like phones and laptops in the past three decades. Depending on battery capacity and size, laptops can now operate more than 15 h and phones may last up to several days per single charge, plus there is support for rapid chargers that can fully recharge batteries in less than an hour. However, save for the new GaN chargers, the progress has been slowing down considerably in the Li-ion sector, as chip makers try to offer increased power efficiency through transistor miniaturization. China now intends to revolutionize this industry with a new type of battery that acts as a micro nuclear reactor promising to offer continuous power for 50 years.Betavolt New Energy Technology Co., Ltd from China successfully developed a micro nuclear energy battery based on the nickel-63 nuclear isotope decay along with the first diamond semiconductor. The battery model is known as BV100 and it is said to generate electricity for 50 years without charging or maintenance. Considering that we now buy new devices every few years, even 2-3 years of continuous power should be sufficient. Betavolt plans to initiate mass production later this year.With such an endeavor, China claims that it is way ahead of Europe and America, which only developed large-size thermonuclear batteries used in the aerospace industry. Betavolt managed to miniaturize the concept and make it viable for portable devices. Just like the large-size batteries, the new BV100 coin-size models convert the energy released by the decay of nuclear isotopes into electrical current through a semiconductor converter. Betavolt tests revealed that the nickel-63 isotope works best for small size batteries, so the BV100 design places a 2 mm thick nickel-63 sheet between 2x 10 mm thick diamond semiconductor layers to facilitate the electrical current conversion.In the promotional material released by Betavolt, the battery appears to include three stacked modules, each with an isotope sheet placed between 2 converter layers. Betavolt explains that it can produce designs with dozens or hundreds of independent unit modules used in parallel, allowing for different sizes and capacities.The BV100 has a volume of only 15 X 15 X 5 mm so power rating is limited to 100 microW at 3V. It produces 8.64 J per day and 3153 J per year. A larger 1 W model is planned to be released by 2025 and that one may be more suitable for phones and drones.Even though it is dealing with radioactive isotopes, Betavolt ensures that this type of battery is safe for the environment and will not catch on fire or explode due to mishandling or harsh conditions. It can safely power medical devices such as pacemakers, artificial hearts and cochleas in the human body. Once it completely decays, the nickel-63 isotope becomes a stable isotope of copper, which is non-radioactive, poses no threat or pollution to the environment and does not require expensive recycling processes.
The Biden administration showed up to last months global climate summit in Dubai with a radical new plan to replace coal and compete again with Russia and China over a technology American scientists pioneered.The United States led nearly two dozen other nations in a pledge to triple the worlds supply of nuclear power by 2050. While most of the reactors under construction in other countries today are Russian models, the U.S. promoted its growing slate of high-tech startups with cutting-edge reactor designs as an American alternative to working with the Kremlin.The big problem with that pitch? The small, next-generation nuclear reactors companies like the one billionaire Bill Gates backs are designed to run on a potent but rare type of uranium fuel with only one commercial supplier on the market: the Russian government.On Tuesday, the Department of Energy offered private companies a minimum of $2 million each to start producing HALEU domestically, the second part of a $500 million tranche of federal dollars for nuclear fuel production from President Joe Bidens climate-spending law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The agency announced the first for a separate part of the HALEU-making process in November.Boosting our domestic uranium supply wont just advance President Bidens historic climate agenda, Ali Zaidi, Bidens national climate adviser, said in a statement, but also increase Americas energy security, create good-paying union jobs, and strengthen our economic competitiveness.All 93 atom-splitting machines operating at U.S. power plants today are conventional light-water reactors based on the technology first commercialized in the 1950s to harness the tremendous heat released from fission reactions to boil water that makes steam that spins turbines to generate huge volumes of nonstop zero-carbon electricity.Light-water reactors are only built to handle fuel made from uranium enriched up to 5% using high-speed gas centrifuges into the unstable uranium-235 isotope needed for a sustained fission reaction. Many of the advanced reactors now vying for regulatory approval in the U.S. are instead designed to handle fuel enriched up to 20%, meaning the technology uses four times as much of the energy per unit of uranium as the traditional variety.While the U.S. and its allies levied unprecedented sanctions on Russias oil, gas and mining companies after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Moscows state-owned Rosatom remains immune as the fourth-largest source of traditional fuel imports for American utilities.The U.S. used to produce most of its own reactor fuel. As part of the 1990s, a Clinton-era deal encouraged the struggling post-Soviet Russia to dismantle its nuclear weapons, however, the U.S. agreed to buy any reactor fuel made from weapons. The cheap supply of Russian fuel put U.S. enrichers out of business, with the last facility closing down a decade ago.Canada, Kazakhstan and Australia  the top three suppliers of uranium to the U.S., respectively  are all looking to increase mining. Frances state-owned uranium company, Orano, announced plans in October to increase enriched fuel production by 30%. Three new uranium mines entered into production in Arizona and Utah in just the past few months.But next-generation reactors that need HALEU suffer from a classic chicken-versus-egg problem. Who can confidently invest in building a first-of-a-kind reactor that needs Russian fuel while the U.S. is trading barbs with Moscow? Who can confidently invest in enriching fuel for reactors that dont currently exist and are not yet even licensed in the U.S.?The federal government is providing an answer to both by pumping billions into propping up advanced reactors and fuel production in hopes they can advance simultaneously in time for the projected start of the new nuclear rollout at the start of the 2030s.But Edward McGinnis, who spent 30 years working on nuclear power at the Energy Department before becoming the chief executive of the fuel-recycling startup Curio, said the Biden administration is overlooking a vital potential source of HALEU: nuclear waste.The spent rods of uranium pellets that come out of traditional reactors after a two-year fuel cycle still contain as much as 97% of their energy  which is why the material remains dangerously radioactive for so long. Companies like Curio want to use special tools to separate all the different radioactive isotopes out of nuclear waste, dramatically reducing how much toxic material needs to be stored long term and increasing the domestic supply of reactor fuel.Recycling nuclear waste is a complicated process that the U.S. government feared in the 1970s would increase the supply of radioactive materials for weapons, banning the nations first facility from opening. France, Russia and Japan all built plants to reprocess uranium fuel. While the U.S. lifted its ban on nuclear recycling in 2005, no company has yet made a serious attempt to build a new facility.The draft letter of the Energy Departments latest request for proposals for enriching HALEU states on page 8 that the uranium used to make the fuel must have been mined and converted, and not come from a source that was recycled or reprocessed. The agency told HuffPost it couldnt determine whether fuel made from recycled uranium would meet the purity standards needed for use in experimental new reactors, so DOE has chosen to focus this procurement on HALEU generated from fresh feedstock supplies.Some people dont realize when were saying we need to support HALEU that recycling can be one of the two solid legs of our future nuclear fuel domestic production capability, McGinnis said by phone Tuesday.The main federal effort for funding nuclear waste recycling is the Energy Departments experimental ARPA-E program, which in 2022 gave out $38 million to companies and laboratories for research, including $5 million to Curio.Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), who chairs the Houses appropriations subcommittee on water and energy, tacked $15 million for reprocessing uranium fuel onto the latest federal budget proposal to help companies advance beyond the research phase into licensing and locating an actual plant.McGinnis said the U.S. hasnt even considered spending that kind of money deploying nuclear waste recycling in at least 15 years. He called on the Senate and White House to champion the measure in budget talks.Youre not only complementing the traditional uranium mining, youre also, by extracting from our so-called nuclear waste, solving to a large degree the nuclear waste problem at the same time, he said.

Some high points have come in 2007, 2015, 2017, and 2024. Each time it has been absolutely critical to attack Iran at once. There could be no delay. Dominoes would fall. Terrorism would prevail. Credibility would be sqandered. And yet, each time, the threatened war has not been launched, and the world has gone on just the same.Weve seen a wide variety of excuses deployed over these years of unsuccessful propaganda for a war on Iran, including false claims about nuclear weapons, the pretense that attacking Iran would improve civil liberties within Iran, and shockingly honest commitments to gaining control of more oil with which to slowly destroy the habitability of the Earth. The push to attack Iran has been on for so long that entire categories of arguments for it (such as that the Iranians are fueling the Iraqi resistance) and demonized leaders of Iran have come and gone. The latest excuse is the killing of three members of the U.S. military.Ordinarily, killing people could be prosecuted as a crime. But thats tricky, because the United States government opposes and refuses to take part in international law, the U.S. troops had no legal justification for being where they were, and the violence across the region is being driven by U.S. support for enormous crimes by the Israeli government.More importantly, the advocates for war do not want to prosecute a crime, but to use a crime as an excuse to commit much larger crimes, on the familiar model of September 11, October 7, etc. The choice to escalate is not imposed on anyone; similar situations in the past have been used as excuses for war and also allowed to pass without the launching of any war.The U.S. government purports to believe that escalating wars will reduce wars, flying in the face of the overwhelming evidence of centuries, and to believe that there is no alternative, even though the demands of all sorts of warmakers across Western Asia are all the same and extremely easy to satisfy (and satisfying them has been ordered by the International Court of Justice): stop destroying Gaza and killing Gazans.The U.S. government distorts the notion of defense beyond all recognition by claiming that harm done to its imperial troops anywhere on Earth can justify a defensive war. This is highly convenient for war hawks in Washington, D.C., who have known for many years that getting U.S. troops killed can be a big propaganda boost for war madness  an idea eagerly encouraged today by U.S. media outlets that are always perfectly capable of demanding revenge while simulaneously calling it defense.This is what the empire of U.S. military bases looks like to Iran. Try to imagine if you lived there, what you would think of this. Who is threatening whom? Who is the greater danger to whom? The point is not that Iran should be free to attack the United States or anyone else because its military is smaller. The point is that doing so would be national suicide. It would also be something Iran has not done for centuries. But it would be typical U.S. behavior.The U.S. overthrew Irans democracy in 1953 and installed a brutal dictator / weapons customer. The U.S. gave Iran nuclear energy technology in the 1970s. Following the Iranian revolution, the United States aided Iraq in the 1980s in attacking Iran, providing Iraq with some of the weapons (including chemical weapons) that were used on Iranians and that would be used in 2002-2003 (when they no longer existed) as an excuse for attacking Iraq.The roots of a Washington push for a new war on Iran can be found in the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, the 1996 paper called A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, the 2000 Rebuilding Americas Defenses, and in a 2001 Pentagon memo described by Wesley Clark as listing these nations for attack: Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. Its worth noting that Bush Jr. overthrew Iraq, and Obama Libya, while the others remain works in progress. The arguments in these old forgotten memos were not what the war makers tell the public, but much closer to what they tell each other. The concerns were those of dominating regions rich in resources, intimidating others, and establishing bases from which to maintain control of puppet governments.In 2000, the CIA gave Iran nuclear bomb plans in an effort to frame it. This was reported by James Risen, and Jeffrey Sterling went to prison for allegedly being Risens source. But nobody involved in the scheme was ever punished in any way.In 2010, Tony Blair included Iran on a list of countries that he said Dick Cheney had aimed to overthrow. The line among the powerful in Washington in 2003 was that Iraq would be a cakewalk but that real men go to Tehran.For many years, the United States has labeled Iran an evil nation, attacked and destroyed the other non-nuclear nation on the list of evil nations, designated part of Irans military a terrorist organization, falsely accused Iran of crimes including the attacks of 9-11, murdered Iranian scientists, funded opposition groups in Iran (including some the U.S. also designates as terrorist), flew dronesover Iran, openly and illegally threatened to attack Iran, and built up military forces all around Irans borders, while imposing cruel sanctions on the country. The long history of the United States lying about Iranian nuclear weapons is chronicled by Gareth Porters book Manufactured Crisis.In 2007, we were told that Iran needed to be attacked urgently due to false claims about nuclear weapons. Even a National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 pushed back and admitted that Iran had no nuclear weapons program.In 2015, Republicans urged war justified by Irans nuclear weapons program, while Democrats successfully moved for passage of an agreement with Iran, also justified by Irans nuclear weapons program. The agreement was not a treaty, and President Trump would later throw it out. But the damage of both sides falsely claiming that Iran had a nuclear weapons program was done.Dick and Liz Cheneys book, Exceptional, tell us we must see a moral difference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. Must we, really? Either risks further proliferation, accidental use, use by a crazed leader, mass death and destruction, environmental disaster, retaliatory escalation, and apocalypse. One of those two nations has nuclear weapons, has used nuclear weapons, has provided the other with plans for nuclear weapons, has a policy of first-use of nuclear weapons, has leadership that sanctions the possession of nuclear weapons, and has frequently threated to use nuclear weapons. I dont think those facts would make a nuclear weapon in the hands of the other country the least bit moral, but also not the least bit more immoral. Lets focus on seeing an empiricaldifference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. One exists. The other doesnt.If youre wondering, U.S. presidents who have made specific public or secret nuclear threats to other nations, that we know of, as documented in Daniel Ellsbergs The Doomsday Machine, have included Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump, while others, including Barack Obama and Donald Trump have frequently said things like All options are on the table in relation to Iran or another country.Proponents of war or steps toward war (sanctions was a step toward the war on Iraq) say we urgently need a war on Iran now, but they have no argument for urgency, and theyve been making the same argument with ever less credibility for years.The Trump White House early on openly expressed a desire to claim that Iran had violated the 2015 nuclear agreement, but produced no evidence. It didnt matter. Trump tore up the agreement anyway and used his own shredding of the agreement as grounds for nuclear fearmongering about Iran.In 2017, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations claimed that Iranian weapons had been used in a war that the U.S.., Saudi Arabia, and allies were illegally and disastrously waging in Yemen. While thats a problem that should be corrected, it is hard to find a war anywhere on the planet without U.S. weapons in it. In fact, a report that made news the same day as the ambassadors claims, pointed to the long-known fact that many of the weapons used by ISIS had once belonged to the United States, many of them having been given by the U.S. to non-state fighters (aka terrorists) in Syria.Fighting wars and arming others to fight wars/terrorism is a justification for indictment and prosecution, but not for war, legally, morally, or practically. The United States fights and arms wars, and no one would be justified in attacking the United States.If Iran is guilty of a crime, and there is evidence to support that claim, the United States and the world should seek its prosecution. Instead, the United States is isolating itself by tearing down the rule of law.President Biden came into office with the possibility wide open to restore the Iran agreement and pursue a better course. He chose not to do so, and not to even try to do so. He waited for a less amendable government to take power in Iran, and then did seemingly everything he could to stir up hostitlities in the region. Now an agreement looks much more difficult to obtain.Of course the reason why real men go to Tehran is that Iran is not the impoverished disarmed nation that one might find in, say, Afghanistan or Iraq, or even the disarmed nation found in Libya in 2011. Iran is much bigger and much better armed. Whether the United States launches a major assault on Iran or Israel does, Iran will retaliate against U.S. troops and probably Israel and possibly the United States itself as well. And the United States will without any doubt re-retaliate for that. Iran cannot be unaware that the U.S. governments pressure on the Israeli government not to attack Iran consists of reassuring the Israelis that the United States will attack when needed, and does not include even threatening to stop funding Israels military or to stop vetoing measures of accountability for Israeli crimes at the United Nations.Of course, many in the U.S. government and military oppose attacking Iran, although key figures like Admiral William Fallon have been moved out of the way. Much of the Israeli military is opposed as well, not to mention the Israeli and U.S. people. But war is not clean or precise. If the people we allow to run our nations attack another, we are all put at risk.Most at risk, of course, are the people of Iran, people as peaceful as any other, or perhaps more so. As in any country, no matter what its government, the people of Iran are fundamentally good, decent, peaceful, just, and fundamentally like you and me. Ive met people from Iran. You may have met people from Iran. They look like this. Theyre not a different species. Theyre not evil. A surgical strike against a facility in their country would cause a great many of them to die very painful and horrible deaths. Even if you imagine that Iran would not retaliate for such attacks, this is what the attacks would in themselves consist of: mass murder.And what would that accomplish? It would unite the people of Iran and much of the world against the United States. It would justify in the eyes of much of the world an underground Iranian program to develop nuclear weapons, a program that probably does not exist at present, except to the extent that legal nuclear energy programs move a country closer to weapons development. The environmental damage would be tremendous, the precedent set incredibly dangerous, all talk of cutting the U.S. military budget would be buried in a wave of war frenzy, civil liberties and representative government would be flushed down the Potomac, a nuclear arms race would spread to additional countries, and any momentary sadistic glee would be outweighed by accelerating home foreclosures, mounting student debt, and accumulating layers of cultural stupidity.Strategically, legally, and morally weapons possession is not grounds for war, and neither is pursuit of weapons possession. And neither, I might add, with Iraq in mind, is theoretically possible pursuit of weapons never acted upon. Israel has nuclear weapons. The United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country but Russia (the two of them together have 90% of the worlds nukes). There can be no justification for attacking the United States, Israel, or any other country. The pretense that Iran has or will soon have nuclear weapons is, in any case, just a pretense, one that has been revived, debunked, and revived again like a zombie for years and years. But thats not the really absurd part of this false claim for something that amounts to no justification for war whatsoever.The really absurd part is that it was the United States in 1976 that pushed nuclear energy on Iran. In 2000 the CIA gave the Iranian government (slightly flawed) plans to build a nuclear bomb. In 2003, Iran proposed negotiations with the United States with everything on the table, including its nuclear technology, and the United States refused. Shortly thereafter, the United States started angling for a war. Meanwhile, U.S.-led sanctions prevent Iran from developing wind energy, while the Koch brothers are allowed to trade with Iran without penalty.Another area of ongoing lie debunking, one that almost exactly parallels the buildup to the 2003 attack on Iraq, is the relentless false claim, including by candidates in 2012 for U.S. President, that Iran has not allowed inspectors into its country or given them access to its sites. Iran had, in fact, prior to the agreement voluntarily accepted stricter standards than the IAEA requires. And of course a separate line of propaganda, albeit a contradictory one, holds that the IAEA has discovered a nuclear weapons program in Iran. Under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), Iran was not required to declare all of its installations, and early last decade it chose not to, as the United States violated that same treaty by blocking Germany, China, and others from providing nuclear energy equipment to Iran. While Iran remains in compliance with the NPT, India and Pakistan and Israel have not signed it and North Korea has withdrawn from it, while the United States and other nuclear powers continuously violate it by failing to reduce arms, by providing arms to other countries such as India, and by developing new nuclear weapons, not to mention keeping nuclear weapons in six European countries, providing Russia to put them into one European country as well.Are you ready for an even more absurd twist? This is on the same scale as Bushs comment about not really giving much thought to Osama bin Laden. Are you ready? The proponents of attacking Iran themselves admit that if Iran had nukes it would not use them. This is from the American Enterprise Institute:The biggest problem for the United States is not Iran getting a nuclear weapon and testing it, its Iran getting a nuclear weapon and not using it. Because the second that they have one and they dont do anything bad, all of the naysayers are going to come back and say, See, we told you Iran is a responsible power. We told you Iran wasnt getting nuclear weapons in order to use them immediately.  And they will eventually define Iran with nuclear weapons as not a problem.Is that clear? Iran using a nuclear weapon would be bad: environmental damage, loss of human life, hideous pain and suffering, yada, yada, yada. But what would be really bad would be Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon and doing what every other nation with them has done since Nagasaki: nothing. That would be really bad because it would damage an argument for war and make war more difficult, thus allowing Iran to run its country as it, rather than the United States, sees fit. Of course it might run it very badly (although the U.S. is hardly establishing a model for the world over here either), but it would run it without U.S. approval, and that would be worse than nuclear destruction.Inspections were allowed in Iraq and they worked. They found no weapons and there were no weapons. Inspections have been allowed in Iran and have worked. However, the IAEA has come under the corrupting influence of the U.S. government. And yet, the bluster from war proponents about IAEA claims over the years is not backed up by any actual claims from the IAEA. And what little material the IAEA has provided for the cause of war has been widely rejected when not being laughed at.Another year, another lie. No longer do we hear that North Korea is helping Iran build nukes. Lies about Iranian backing of Iraqi resisters have faded. (Didnt the United States back French resistance to Germans at one point?) Another recent concoction is the Iran did 911 lie. Revenge, like the rest of these attempted grounds for war, is actually not a legal or moral justification for war. But the 9/11 fiction has already been put to rest by the indespensable Gareth Porter, among others. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which did play a role in 911 as well as in the Iraqi resistance, is being sold record quantities of that good old leading U.S. export of which were all so proud: weapons of mass destruction.Oh, I almost forgot another lie that hasnt quite entirely faded yet. Iran did not try to blow up a Saudi ambassador in Washington, D.C., an action which President Obama would have considered perfectly praiseworthy if the roles were reversed, but a lie that even Fox News had a hard time stomaching. And thats saying something.And then theres that old standby: Ahmadinejad said Israel should be wiped off the map. While this does not, perhaps, rise to the level of John McCain singing about bombing Iran or Bush and Obama swearing that all options including nuclear attack are on the table, it sounds extremely disturbing: wiped off the map! However, the translation is a bad one. A more accurate translation was the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time. The government of Israel, not the nation of Israel. Not even the government of Israel, but the current regime. Hell, Americans say that about their own regimes all the time, alternating every four to eight years depending on political party (some of us even say it all the time, without immunity for either party). Iran has made clear it would approve of a two-state solution if Palestinians approved of it. If the U.S. launched missile strikes every time somebody said something stupid, even if accurately translated, how safe would it be to live near Newt Gingrichs or Joe Bidens house?Luckily, war resisters have succeeded for so long (even while telling each other that they never succeed) that the war mongers dont remember who Ahmadinejad even was anymore, and all that demonization has gone to nought.The real danger may not actually be the lies. The Iraq experience has built up quite a mental resistance to these sorts of lies in many U.S. residents. The real danger may be the slow start of a war that gains momentum on its own without any formal announcement of its initiation. Israel and the United States have not just been talking tough or crazy. Theyve been murdering Iranians. And they seem to have no shame about it. The day after a Republican presidential primary debate at which candidates declared their desire to kill Iranians, the CIA apparently made certain the news was public that it was in fact already murdering Iranians, not to mention blowing up buildings. Some would say and have said that the war has already begun. Those who cannot see this because they do not want to see it will also miss the deadly humor in the United States asking Iran to return its brave drone.There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war. The one that interested me the most was why dont we build  we in our shipyard  build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats. Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms. And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz, start a shoot-up. Might cost some lives. And it was rejected because you cant have Americans killing Americans. Thats the kind of  thats the level of stuff were talking about. Provocation. But that was rejected.Now, Dick Cheney is not your typical American. Nobody in the U.S. government is your typical American. Your typical American is struggling, disapproves of the U.S. government, wishes billionaires were taxed, favors green energy and education and jobs over military boondoggles, thinks corporations should be barred from buying elections, and would not be inclined to apologize for getting shot in the face by the Vice President.Back in the 1930s, the Ludlow Amendment nearly made it a Constitutional requirement that the public vote in a referendum before the United States could go to war. President Franklin Roosevelt blocked that proposal. Yet the Constitution already required and still requires that Congress declare war before a war is fought. That has not been done in almost 80 years, while wars have raged on almost incessantly. In the past decade and right up through President Obamas signing of the outrageous National Defense Authorization Act on New Years Eve 2011-2012, the power to make war has been handed over to presidents. Here is one more reason to oppose a presidential war on Iran: once you allow presidents to make wars, you will never stop them. Another reason, in so far as anybody any longer gives a damn, is that war is a crime. Iran and the United States are parties to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which bans war. One of those two nations is not complying.But we wont have a referendum. The U.S. House of Misrepresentatives wont step in. Only through widespread public pressure and nonviolent action will we intervene in this slow-motion catastrophe. This war, if it happens, will be fought by an institution called the United States Department of Defense, but it will endanger rather than defending us. As the war progresses, we will be told that the Iranian people want to be bombed for their own good, for freedom, for democracy. But nobody wants to be bombed for that. Iran does not want U.S.-style democracy. Even the United States does not want U.S.-style democracy. We will be told that those noble goals are guiding the actions of our brave troops and our brave drones on the battlefield. Yet there will be no battlefield. There will be no front lines. There will be no trenches. There will simply be cities and towns where people live, and where people die. There will be no victory. There will be no progress accomplished through a surge. On January 5, 2012, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was asked at a press conference about the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he replied simply that those were successes. That is the kind of success that could be expected in Iran were Iran a destitute and disarmed state.Now we begin to understand the importance of all the media suppression, blackouts, and lies about the damage done to Iraq and Afghanistan. Now we understand why Obama and Panetta embraced the lies that launched the War on Iraq. The same lies must now be revived, as for every war ever fought, for a War on Iran. Heres a video explaining how this will work, even with some new twistsand lots of variations. The U.S. corporate media is part of the war machine.Planning war and funding war creates its own momentum. Sanctions become, as with Iraq, a stepping stone to war. Cutting off diplomacy leaves few options open. Electoral pissing contests take us allwhere most of us did not want to be.These are the bombs most likely to launch this ugly and quite possibly terminal chapter of human history. This animation shows clearly what they would do. For an even better presentation, pair that with this audio of a misinformed caller trying hopelessly to persuade George Galloway that we should attack Iran.On January 2, 2012, the New York Times reported concern that cuts to the U.S. military budget raised doubts as to whether the United States would be prepared for a grinding, lengthy ground war in Asia. At a Pentagon press conference on January 5, 2012, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reassured the press corpse (sic) that major ground wars were very much an option and that wars of one sort or another were a certainty. President Obamas statement of military policy released at that press conference listed the missions of the U.S. military. First was fighting terrorism, next detering aggression, then projecting power despite anti-access/area denial challenges, then the good old WMDs, then conquering space and cyberspace, then nuclear weapons, and finally  after all that  there was mention of defending the Homeland Formerly Known As The United States.The cases of Iraq and Iran are not identical in every detail, of course. But in both cases we are dealing with concerted efforts to get us into wars, wars based, as all wars are based, on lies. We may need to revive this appeal to U.S. and Israeli forces!Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).
