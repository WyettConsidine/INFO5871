Pethokoukis is an economic policy analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, CNBC contributor, and author of The Conservative Futurist: How to Create the Sci-Fi World We Were Promised. You can also read his newsletter, Faster, Please! on Substack.We live in an emerging age of technological signs and wonders. Among the tantalizing possibilities: Genetic medicine to cure Alzheimers and cancer. Reusable rockets to build an orbital economy and Moon colony. New kinds of nuclear reactors that are easier to build and could supply nearly limitless clean energy. And the next U.S. president just might step to the podium in the West Wing and announce that an American technology company has created an artificial intelligence as smart as the best human mind. Such a seemingly sci-fi advance could radically change the job market, government finances, scientific research, and, really, the entire American way of lifeyet almost certainly for the better overall, as I explain in my new book, The Conservative Futurist: How to Create the Sci-Fi World We Were Promised.No guarantees, however, that any of these marvels will happen anytime soon. History suggests skepticism is warranted. Last year marked the 50th anniversary of what I call the Great Downshift, a slow-motion economic catastrophe right up there with the Great Depression as the biggest disaster in American economic history. In 1973, U.S. labor productivity growthworker output per hour, the critical factor driving long-term improvement in living standardscollapsed during a nasty two-year recession and never really recovered for any extended length of time except for the few years of the internet boom before and after the year 2000. If productivity growth had merely remained at the pace seen in the years before 1973, the size of the American economy would be roughly 50 percent larger than it is today, or $40 trillion rather than $26 trillion. And had it accelerated as some were predicting back then, Americans might be twice or three times as rich as they are today.What exactly happened a half-century ago remains an economic mystery. Nothing so significant has a single cause. But one of the most probable suspects is simply that we failed to dream up new technological marvels anywhere near as economically important as those of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the internal combustion engine and widespread electrification. The combination of the personal computer and internet was important, of course, but not enough on its own to return the economy to the productivity growth rates of the past.  Unlike those great inventions of old, economist Robert Gordon has explained, the Information Technology Revolution generated benefits that were more narrowly focusedpredominantly concentrated on entertainment and communications, such as advancements from VCRs to smartphonesand reached a point of diminishing returns more quickly. Productive progress in the world of atoms rather than bits, such as energy, housing, and transportation, has been more modest.Yet when the future optimists of the immediate postwar decadestechnologists, CEOs, think tankers, and hard science-fiction writers such as Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimovimagined the world of the early 21st century, they assumed advances of the sort we are only now seeing in AI, biology, energy, and space would be old news. We should also be well on our way to controlling the weather, mining asteroids, and, of course, zipping around in flying cars. Their biggest mistake wasnt perhaps just underestimating the technical difficulties of achieving such advances. They also assumed that key factors enabling such leaps were a permanent feature of the American political economy: massive federal spending on R&D, an unfettered regulatory environment, and a broadly techno-optimistic culture supportive of such pro-progress policies no matter the downsides. In other words, a Neverending 50 and 60s.How fast technological progress goes depends on how much we, as a society, want it, Arthur Turrell, a plasma physicist whose book The Star Builders: Nuclear Fusion and the Race to Power the Planet documents the effort to achieve nuclear fusion, told me soon after the energy breakthrough in December 2022. Societal will and investment can speed up technologyjust look at the development and deployment of vaccines during the [coronavirus pandemic]. Given that achieving fusion is perhaps the greatest technological challenge weve ever taken on as a species, funding for fusion to date has not been equal to the task. Progress could have been much faster.Well, better late than never. Generative AI models by themselves could return productivity growth to what it was before the Great Downshift,accordingto the bank Goldman Sachs[LW3][JP4], by automating some of what workers do and making them more efficient at doing other tasks. More gains could come from accelerating scientific research. Tamay Besiroglu, a visiting research scientist at MITs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,thinksAI automating crucial scientific and engineering tasks, like drug discovery and chip design, could potentially amplify productivity growth rates by five times or more by mid-century. If so, the American economy could be multiples bigger than Washington is currently expecting.But it would be a potentially massive mistake to just assume a giant leap forward is guaranteed as did the optimists of the 1960s and late 1990s. For this broad technological revolution to reach its full potential as fast as possible, we need to avoid the mistakes of the past. We need to reform and repeal 1970s-era environmental regulations that make it maddeningly hard to build big projects in America today, either quickly or cheaply. Likewise, America needs to again spend at Project Apollo levels on the science research, or a tripling as a share of GDP, that drives technological progress and long-term economic growth. Doubling total national R&D spending, both public and private, could raise U.S. productivity and real per-capita income growth rates by 0.5 percentage points per year, according to Northwestern University economist Benjamin Jones.But new technologies and better policies arent enough. With rapid progress comes disruption to the status quo. Humans have an innate bias against change, behavioral economists find, such as fearing big changes to a current job even if the result might be higher pay down the line. We need a culture that can help us imagine how tech progress and growth can create a future we would want to live in. If not, well be reluctant to accept the inherent disruptionto our jobs, our companies, and our communitiesthat comes with change. But coincident with the Great Downshift in productivity growth was a long-term change of national attitude about the future, one for the worse. Yale University economist Ray Fair sees the early-1970s decline in U.S. infrastructure spending as a share of GDP and the start of persistent government budget deficits as suggesting that the United States became less future oriented beginning around 1970. This change has persisted." The logic: Repairing your roof while the sun is shining and curbing spending before the bill collector calls require foresight and the ability to place the current you in the shoes of the future you.But government stats only tell part of the story here. The other part is the actual stories we started telling ourselves. Influenced by an emerging environmental movement that was certain our techno-capitalist civilization risked collapse from overpopulation (see 1968's The Population Bomb) and overconsumption (see 1972's The Limits to Growth), Hollywood began delivering a steady diet of dystopia and never really stopped. Is it any wonder that three-fourths of Americans want to slow the development of AI when our cultural touchstone is The Terminator, a film franchise frequently mentioned in media stories about the technology? Is it any surprise that many young people suffer from climate anxiety when films and TV shows suggest were helpless to do much about it? Extrapolations, a recent big-budget, star-studded Apple TV+ series, depicts a wrecked future where national leaders could never get their act together. (No mention of nuclear power, by the way.)Even the American president isnt immune. Before issuing his new executive order on AI last October, Joe Biden watched the Tom Cruise film Mission: ImpossibleDead Reckoning Part One while spending the weekend at Camp David. The films villain is a sentient AI: If [Biden] hadnt already been concerned about what could go wrong with AI before that movie, he saw plenty more to worry about, said White House aide Bruce Reed, who watched the film with the president.Better pro-growth policy would help tremendously. A new study from Harvard University finds that people who grow up in times of economic abundance and growth tend to have a positive-sum mindset, believing the pie can expand for all. But those raised in tougher conditions are more zero-sum. They're skeptical that hard work brings success. But we also need to tell ourselves a more optimistic story of the future. Credit to Jeff Bezos for having Amazon Studios continue The Expanse series after it was canceled by the SyFy network. The show depicts humanity surviving climate change, colonizing the solar system, and living longer. More billionaires could also directly finance optimistic media like Elon Musk's Mars colonization videos. New AI tools will increasingly allow future optimists to create their own sophisticated images of the future if Hollywood wont.Our schools also have a role to play in creating a more risk-taking generation. They should assign classic adventures from Jules Verne, Jack London, and Laura Ingalls Wilder, and modern books like Andy Weir's The Martian about an innovative astronaut stranded on Mars. We could also devise pro-progress thought experiments like a "Genesis Clock" that tracks indicators of scientific and economic advancement as a conceptual counter to the famous Doomsday Clock. I, for one, am more interested in how many minutes to a Dawn of civilizational superabundance than a supposed Midnight of human extinction.The conservative futurist Herman Kahn said humanity would be fine barring disastrous luck or incredibly bad decisions. Bad luck can create opportunity, however. Russias invasion of Ukraine and the difficulty of reducing carbon emissions with wind and solar alone have given new life to nuclear energy around the world. Tensions with China provide an excuse to treat and fund AI as the new Space Race.After a half century of disappointment, Ill take whatever help I can get if it means a future of radically reduced poverty, healthier lives, and a society resilient to existential problems, from climate change to pandemics to a stray chunk of space ice slamming into our planet. Flying cars would be nice, too.
Nuclear energy was an unexpected winner at COP28, the United Nations global climate conference that recently concluded in the United Arab Emirates. More than 24 countries, including the United States, and 120 companies committed to tripling nuclear energy by 2050 as an essential part of mitigating climate change. The principal goal is carbon-free energy available 24/7 as an essential complement to variable wind and solar electricity. After years of skepticism, there is growing political momentum for nuclear energy, but if countries follow the current model of plant construction, they will not get where they have pledged to go. The world needs a new strategy for nuclear energy deployment that furthers climate goals, enhances grid reliability, and ensures that achieving energy security doesnt erode global security.To make good on the COP pledge, accounting for a ramp-up time, the world will soon need to build the equivalent of about 50 large nuclear power reactors per year until 2050. This is two-thirds more than were built at nuclear powers peak in the early 1980s, and the current pace of construction is well short of that.Seventeen countries are building just one or two reactors at a time, each sometimes taking over a decade to build. In the West, nuclear construction projects are often long, complex, and characterized by delays and cost over-runs. Regulatory uncertainty and long timelines discourage investment. China, Russia, South Korea, and now the UAE have demonstrated the ability to build new nuclear reactors effectively, but this alone is clearly insufficient. Newcomer nuclear countries like Poland, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines are looking to deploy domestically, but it will take time and considerable resources to meet simultaneously their project management, regulatory, security, finance and workforce ambitions.To succeed, nations must rethink how to build, regulate, and finance nuclear technology. The United States offers a case in point. The second of two new-build gigawatt-scale nuclear reactors in Georgia is showing the immense value of learning from experience, but there arent any other projects in the pipeline to take advantage of those lessons learned. The next US nuclear build will likely need to go back to basics without the benefits of an experienced workforce as technology evolves and schedules from commitment to operation extend well over a decade.A new system will need to deliver standardized products rather than costly and risky one-off multi-decade projects. This could mean relying on proven designs of gigawatt-scale reactors, or embracing a selection of new smaller designs amenable to assembly-line methods (analogous to those in the airline and shipbuilding industries), or some combination of both. Many countries, including the United States, have expressed strong interest in small modular reactors, but the reality is that little progress is being made.It will require groups of customers of zero-carbon always-available electricity  utilities, large industrial users, large IT companies  to agree to purchase electricity or heat from dozens of nuclear plants of the same design. This so-called orderbook approach, common in the aviation industry, would address many flaws of the current model by sending a durable demand signal to the nuclear supply chain, pooling resources, and unlocking workforce development, thereby reducing risks and costs. With each new reactor built, countries, companies, investors, and policy makers also learn more, saving time and money.Public-private partnerships will probably be needed to implement this vision. Governments can help motivate the parties by offering financial risk backstops that could provide further confidence to private-sector developers, lowering first-of-a-kind risks. But more may be needed to launch a true nuclear renaissance, since nuclear construction is capital intensive. Especially for countries launching new nuclear programs, multilateral banks such as the World Bank and European Investment Bank must rebuild their nuclear finance capabilities and provide necessary capital to support the formation of orderbook transactions; new multilateral facilities might be considered as well.In addition, the current process for certifying nuclear reactor designs is based on an inefficient country-by-country approach. Developing an international body charged with issuing a single globally accepted generic certification for reactor designs would further lower the barriers to nuclear deployment. Nuclear can look to the aviation industrys model, which certifies aircraft, subject to strict and uniform standards, across countries.Current geopolitical tensions in Europe and in the Middle East reinforce the importance of scaling up in a way that maintains strong nuclear nonproliferation and security standards. If greater energy security leads to more nuclear weapons, the nuclear energy enterprise will be compromised. Countries can meet these standards by tried and true practices of allowing international monitoring, relying on the international market for fuel rather than enriching their own, and avoiding weapons-usable materials as fuel. New approaches to transparency and verification can simultaneously alleviate concerns and free up unfettered international assistance.Countries dont need to wait to get started. The organization charged with ensuring the safe, secure, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is convening heads of state in Brussels in March to focus on expanding nuclear energy. This presents an important opportunity to begin putting the pieces of the plan outlined here in place. Countries should come ready to support the formation of orderbooks for specific nuclear reactor designs. Leaders should also lay the groundwork for enhanced regional and international institutions focusing on regulatory standardization, financial support, and workforce development.While each country will need to pursue its own individual pathway to nuclear energy, its essential the international community collectively reforms the system to enable success. Having recognized the need to expand nuclear energy, countries must now focus on cooperative implementation and work together to create the conditions for sustained scale-up of this important climate and energy security solution.Ernest J.

Its a very, very sad situation  its upsetting a lot of tribes in this region, said Carletta Tilousi, a former Havasupai council member who has been leading the tribes opposition to uranium mining in the south-west. But I think we all knew this was eventually going to happen.But an agreement at Cop28 to triple nuclear energy production as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has boosted demand. Energy Fuels Inc began operations at the Pinyon Plain mine in December and has also begun ramping up production at its Pandora and La Sal mines in Utah, near Moab.The company cited rising uranium prices in a statement about its activities, as well as increased buying interest from US nuclear utilities, US and global government policies supporting nuclear energy to address global climate change, and the need to reduce US reliance on Russian and Russian-controlled uranium and nuclear fuel among their reasons to ramp-up production. The US still buys uranium from Russia, despite sanctions imposed after Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but lawmakers have been seeking to divest from the country.The Arizona department of environmental quality (ADEQ) in 2022 issued an aquifer protection permit to the company, after it showed it was using the latest systems to prevent discharge from filtering into groundwater reserves. There is no science to support the contention that groundwater is at risk, Curtis Moore, a spokesperson with Energy Fuel, told the Guardian.Prior to issuing the permit, ADEQ professionals spent more than one thousand hours conducting a comprehensive review of this extensive technical record before determining that adverse impacts to groundwater were extremely unlikely, a spokesperson for the agency said. The agency reviewed environmental studies, permits, engineering and hydrological reports over 30 years information from the US Geological Survey, to conclude that the rock layers between the mine and the Redwall-Muav aquifer that the Havasupai Tribe relies on are highly impermeable.For the Havasupai Nation, such reassurances are not enough, said Tilousi. In the four corners region of the south-west, the uranium mining in the 20th century littered the Navajo Nation with abandoned mines and tainted aquifers, leaving a generation of Din workers and their families with lung cancer and other respiratory illness. The Havasupai and other Indigenous communities are weary, she said.Were not willing to risk the livelihood of my community  of 767 tribal members  for the sake of one mining company, she said. One mishap or misestimation could risk permanently contaminating the sole water source for the tribe, she argued, in a drought-stricken region where water supplies are already limited.The tribe, as well as local environmental groups, argue that theres been no extensive study of how groundwater in the region moves and that a plan to undertake long-term study of water impacts first proposed by the Obama administration had stalled.And, they say, past incidents at the site are cause for concern. In 2016, mine-shaft drilling by Energy Fuel pierced shallow aquifers, causing a surge of contaminated water. In 2017, when the facilitys evaporation pond approached capacity, miners spayed contaminated water into the nearby Kaibab national forest.We encountered shallow, isolated aquifers when we drove the shaft, but this was planned and anticipated by us and the regulators, Moore said, disputing that the 2016 incident was an issue. In 2017, he said the company swiftly responded and adapted systems to prevent such an occurrence in the future.The mine also abuts two of the tribes most sacred sites  Wiii Gdwiisa and Mat Taav Tiivjunmdva. The tribes creation stories centre on those sites, but fall outside their trust land borders, after they were evicted from the Grand Canyon National Park in 1919.Bidens national monument declaration last year prevented new mining claims within the borders of Baaj Nwaavjo Itah Kukveni, but due to the stipulations of an 1872 mining law, mines under development prior to the federal governments projections were exempted from the ban. The Gold Rush-era law, which still governs mining operations, allowed miners to seize public lands without regard for whether the sites had been home to Indigenous people  and environmental groups are continuing to push for its reform.There are so many reasons why this mine doesnt belong where it is, said Amber Reimondo, the energy director with the Grand Canyon Trust, an environmental group focused on protecting the region. And the fact that it is allowed to operate is a stark example of the weaknesses in our regulatory system.Across the south-west, local communities and tribes have been pushing back against uranium mining proposals, including in Utah, where the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe is concerned about air pollution from a nearby Energy Fuels mill facility. Similar tensions have arisen around lithium mining in the west, as a need for the metal in clean energy components grows.In the rush to move away from fossil fuels, we are neglecting communities and recreating cycles of harm, Reimondo said. In order to have a truly just clean energy future, we have to actually work with Indigenous communities.General Motors has hired battery expert and ex-Tesla executive Kurt Kelty to be the automaker's new vice president of batteries -- a brand new role for the company.  Kelty will join GM at a time when the company has struggled to increase the output of the battery packs for its new Ultium platform, which is supposed to power its next-generation electric vehicles.  The foundation that GM has established coupled with Kurts exceptional battery expertise in leading battery chemistry development, establishing partnerships, building out supply chains and partnering closely with teams that have developed leading battery systems will help us achieve our electrification goals and position GM as a leader in EV technology, GM president Mark Reuss said in a statement.GenAI might be one of the most exciting technologies today.  With each new GenAI innovation, companies have to worry not only about staying on top of trends but validating what's working, all while maintaining a semblance of accuracy, compliance and security.  Arcee, for instance, is creating solutions to help businesses securely train, benchmark and manage GenAI models, and Articul8 AI, an Intel spin-out, is building algorithm-powered enterprise software.To build a fusion power plant, engineers are forced to make some difficult choices.  Thea Energy is hoping that both is the right answer.  The startup is betting that software can supplant manufacturing precision in its quest to deliver reliable, inexpensive fusion power.Californias auto regulator, theDepartment of Motor Vehicles (DMV), is investigating an incident that occurred on Tuesday, where a driverless Waymo car collided with a cyclist, according to a report by Reuters.  San Francisco cops said that the cyclist suffered non-fatal injuries, as per a report by SFGate.  Waymo, which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said there was only one person in the car, who didnt suffer injuries.India's central bank said Thursday it takes supervisory actions and imposes business restrictions only after "persistent non-compliance" with rules, its first comment after a clampdown on Paytm last week has posed existential questions about the future of the leading financial services firm.  Shaktikanta Das, the Reserve Bank of India governor, said the central bank always engages with regulated entities bilaterally and nudges them to take corrective action.  If the central bank takes actions, "it is always proportionate to the gravity of the situation," said Das, pictured above, in a media briefing.Attentive.ai, a startup building vertical software for landscaping and construction services in the U.S., has raised $7 million in a new funding round as it looks to enhance its AI-led offerings and expand them to more businesses.  Led by Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India, the all-equity Series A round, which follows the earlier $5 million seed investment, also received participation from Attentive.ai's existing investors: Peak XV's Surge and InfoEdge Ventures.  Additionally, Mumbai-based investment firm Tenacity Ventures has come on board this time through a secondary investment.
Building a nuclear submarine program from scratch is anything but easy, but when they set out to do so, the Australian navy knew exactly who to turn to for expertise. Shortly after the announcement, Australian Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead in an interview suggested sending staff to MIT.That offhand comment eventually found its way to Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering and director of the Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems at MIT, and served as inspiration for the newest executive education course offered by the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE).Titled "Nuclear Technology for Marine Propulsion," the three-week course was attended by 20 senior leaders from the Australian Submarine Agency (ASA) and other officials, and covered a broad range of topics, including the basics of nuclear reactor theory and design, operations and safety, training, the operation of nuclear shipyards, and more."NSE is truly excited for the opportunity to help the Australian navy as they navigate the establishment of their nuclear program," says Benoit Forget, NSE department head and Korea Electric Power Professor of Nuclear Engineering, who co-directed the course. "Understanding the technology and establishing foundational safety principles is essential to the long-term success of their project, and we were glad to see the importance they attributed to these principles by seeking our help."Sessions were led by MIT faculty and a variety of external subject matter experts and included special guests like MIT Vice President for Research Maria Zuber and retired U.S. Navy admirals Jim Ellis and John Richardson."The technical content of the course was rich," Buongiorno says. "We started with nuclear physics, reactor physics, thermal-hydraulics, nuclear materials, fuel performance, and the nuclear fuel cycle, and then expanded into what one might call the 'softer' aspects of nuclear technology, such as training, oversight, safety culture, supply chain, the role of the national labs, etc.""For example, in-depth training of people and the creation of a robust safety culture are critically important because nuclear reactors are not a particularly tolerant technology," he continues. "Hence the need for relentless attention to detail and conservative decision-making. Therefore, we felt from the very beginning that this should not be a purely technical course."While it is the newest professional education course offered by NSE, the ASA course was modeled after another course, called "Reactor Technology Course for Nuclear Utility Executives," which the department has offered for more than three decades, jointly with the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. In both cases, Buongiorno says, the goal is to ensure participants come away with a basic understanding of nuclear technology, feel confident to ask smart questions, and make the right decisions in their respective positions.Given the important future roles of the course participants - many were senior leaders in the Australian navy, government, and policy community - the course may end up having significant impacts, he adds."The Australian navy course is one more recent example of the international involvement and impact of my NSE colleagues," Forget says. "Two additional recent examples are the Global Forum Rising Stars Workshop, in collaboration with the Nuclear Energy Agency, that brought together incredible female researchers from around the world, and the 2023 David J. Rose Lecture given by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mariano Grossi, who discussed the role of the IAEA on global nuclear safety."Providing such executive education, Buongiorno says, is central to MIT NSE's mission. In addition to courses for the ASA and utility executives, the department in recent years launched a three-day course for policymakers, legislators, journalists, and others, titled Nuclear Energy: Facts and Issues, has offered a course on Nuclear Operational Risk Management for a decade, and its longest-running course, on Nuclear Plant Safety, has been offered annually since 1966."The mission of our department is not limited to technology development and education of our students. It includes also informing the broader community of stakeholders in the media, the government, the industry, the investment community, all the way to the general public, about the beneficial uses of nuclear science and technologies," he says.That offhand comment eventually found its way to Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering and director of the Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems at MIT, and served as inspiration for the newest executive education course offered by the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE).Titled "Nuclear Technology for Marine Propulsion," the three-week course was attended by 20 senior leaders from the Australian Submarine Agency (ASA) and other officials, and covered a broad range of topics, including the basics of nuclear reactor theory and design, operations and safety, training, the operation of nuclear shipyards, and more."NSE is truly excited for the opportunity to help the Australian navy as they navigate the establishment of their nuclear program," says Benoit Forget, NSE department head and Korea Electric Power Professor of Nuclear Engineering, who co-directed the course.

Rose Lecture given by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mariano Grossi, who discussed the role of the IAEA on global nuclear safety."Providing such executive education, Buongiorno says, is central to MIT NSE's mission. In addition to courses for the ASA and utility executives, the department in recent years launched a three-day course for policymakers, legislators, journalists, and others, titled Nuclear Energy: Facts and Issues, has offered a course on Nuclear Operational Risk Management for a decade, and its longest-running course, on Nuclear Plant Safety, has been offered annually since 1966."The mission of our department is not limited to technology development and education of our students. It includes also informing the broader community of stakeholders in the media, the government, the industry, the investment community, all the way to the general public, about the beneficial uses of nuclear science and technologies," he says.Sessions were led by MIT faculty and a variety of external subject matter experts and included special guests like MIT Vice President for Research Maria Zuber and retired U.S. Navy admirals Jim Ellis and John Richardson."The technical content of the course was rich," Buongiorno says. "We started with nuclear physics, reactor physics, thermal-hydraulics, nuclear materials, fuel performance, and the nuclear fuel cycle, and then expanded into what one might call the 'softer' aspects of nuclear technology, such as training, oversight, safety culture, supply chain, the role of the national labs, etc.""For example, in-depth training of people and the creation of a robust safety culture are critically important because nuclear reactors are not a particularly tolerant technology," he continues. "Hence the need for relentless attention to detail and conservative decision-making. Therefore, we felt from the very beginning that this should not be a purely technical course."While it is the newest professional education course offered by NSE, the ASA course was modeled after another course, called "Reactor Technology Course for Nuclear Utility Executives," which the department has offered for more than three decades, jointly with the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations.

On a windy day last August, President Joe Biden signed a proclamation protecting the canyons, cliffs, and plateaus surrounding the Grand Canyon National Park, nearly a million acres abutting the Navajo Nation and Havasupai Indian Reservation.Biden said the new national monument was part of his commitment to Native peoples to protect their sacred lands. Preserving the Grand Canyon as a national park was used to deny Indigenous people full access to their homelands, Biden acknowledged.To Carletta Tilousi, one of the leaders of the Havasupai Tribe who have called the Grand Canyon home for more than 800 years, Bidens presence and his words felt momentous. Finally, the small voices of Indigenous people have been heard in the White House, she thought.But she knew the fight was not over. The monument prevented hundreds of mining claims, but two uranium mines were grandfathered in, in part due to an 1872 law that guaranteed their right to operate. And now, nearly 40 years after first gaining permission to extract uranium, a Colorado-based company is cashing in.The companys decision was influenced by favorable federal policies supporting nuclear energy, high prices for uranium ore, and greater demand for domestic nuclear fuel. The U.S. purchased 12 percent of its uranium from Russia in 2022, and theres growing political pressure to stop those imports in the face of Russias war against Ukraine.    The 17-acre Pinyon Plain Mine is 12 miles from the Grand Canyon, six miles from the Grand Canyon National Park, and four miles north of Red Butte, a site sacred to the Havasupai people where Biden gave his August address. The Havasupai Tribe sued along with environmental groups to prevent the mine from starting production, but lost its case in 2022.Energy Fuels plans to operate the mine for three years to six years and estimates that it will generate 2 million pounds of uranium, says Curtis Moore, senior vice president of marketing and corporate development.After mining operations are complete, the Pinyon Plain area will be fully reclaimed and returned to its natural state, the company has promised. There will be virtually no evidence a mine ever occupied the site.Amber Reimondo is doubtful. Shes energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the Grand Canyon and the Colorado Plateau that sued to prevent the mine along with the Havasupai Tribe, and says uranium mining threatens the aquifer in the greater Grand Canyon area.According to Reimondo, water systems in the landscape are complex and interconnected. Energy Fuels mining process involves drilling a mine shaft through shallow aquifers into uranium deposits, and water flows into the shaft, mixing with the ore, before being pumped out. The concern is that contaminated water will be mixed back into the groundwater.To date, the company has removed about 49 million gallons of water from the shaft, leaving it to evaporate in an aboveground pool or sharing it with local ranchers for their cattle once treated to EPA standards. Reimondo worries that water could eventually contaminate not only drinking water sources but the creeks and waterfalls throughout the Grand Canyon.Its really, really difficult for researchers to understand exactly what that risk is, because the region is so highly fractured and because we dont know exactly where water flows to and from, Reimondo said.Energy Fuels Curtis Moore thinks that concern is overblown. He said that the water that the company pumps out of the shaft is already highly concentrated in uranium because it has been in contact with the rocks long before their mining operations started.Their implication is that we are contaminating groundwater, which is simply false  its naturally not appropriate for human consumption, he said. He pointed to a 2022 permit from the state of Arizona that concluded the geology of the mine site like the slope of the land and type of rock are expected to prevent any potential impacts to groundwater resulting from mining operations.A separate 2021 study by scientists from the U.S. Geological Society found that the type of uranium mining conducted at Pinyon Plain Mine has historically had no confirmed effects on uranium levels in the groundwater sampled in and around the Grand Canyon. But the study also noted that it could take many years for any related pollution to reach the groundwater.That potential for negative long-term effects are what Havasupai Tribe members are concerned about. Dianna Uqualla, a Havasupai Tribal Council member, says if theres pollution in the aquifer years from now, she doubts anyone will take responsibility.Whos going to pay the price? she asked. Whos going to be the one to say, Yeah, I did it? I dont think anybodys going to do that. Theyre just going to say, Well, one less tribe, and were happy for that, is what the non-Natives will probably think.Uqualla is familiar with the long history of damage wrought by uranium mining on Native lands. In the nearby Navajo Nation, years of uranium mining caused lung cancer and a decadeslong struggle to get compensation. The mining was so widely harmful that the Navajo Nation has banned the transport of radioactive and related materials through their lands.Despite that ban, once mined, the uranium ore from Pinyon Plain Mine will be trucked to the White Mesa Mill in southern Utah along state and federal highways, including through Navajo Nation. Navajo President Buu Nygren has implored the federal government to step in on the matter.Once the ore makes it to White Mesa Mill, the company will extract natural uranium concentrate from the uranium ore, before selling the powder to U.S. nuclear power facilities, which arrange for the concentrate to be sent to other facilities for conversion and enrichment.Tilousi wishes that Congress would update the 1872 mining law that allowed Energy Fuels to continue operating a mine on a national monument. Thats something the Biden administration has recommended too, in part because the law allows companies to hold mining rights for long periods of time, which sows distrust among local communities including Indigenous peoples.Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

The fund plans to invest in the expansion of clean energy, accelerate sustainable solutions and technologies, and help companies within carbon-intensive sectors transition to more sustainable business practices. Its seed portfolio reportedly includes an onshore renewables developer in the United Kingdom and a solar partnership in India.Brookfield also expresses plans to achieve a larger fundraiser than its previous transition fund. The Canadian companys first fund closed at $15 billion in June of 2022, becoming the largest fund of its kind in the world. Investments from that first financing round are currently going toward renewable power, business transformation, carbon capture and storage, renewable natural gas, and nuclear services.We have demonstrated beyond doubt the breadth and scale of attractive investment opportunities in the transition to a net zero economy, said Mark Carney, chair and head of transition investing for Brookfield. By going where the emissions are, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund strategy is aiming to deliver strong risk-adjusted financial returns for investors and make meaningful environmental impacts for people and the planet.In November 2023, Brookfield and Cameco jointly acquired global nuclear giant, Westinghouse, citing a lasting demand outlook for nuclear power. Westinghouse is the core service provider for over 50% of the worlds operating nuclear reactors. The company has also developed small modular reactors and other next-generation advanced reactors, which are expected to drive future nuclear energy development.Despite mixed opinions on nuclear powers role in the clean energy transition, the industry has been identified as a major contributor to meeting global electricity demand through clean energy sources.Nuclear is currently the second largest global source of clean energy after hydropower, and the International Energy Agency expects nuclear energy generation to reach an all-time global high by early 2025 to meet this rising demand. The U.K. also released plans earlier this year to increase nuclear generation by up to four times its current amounts, making the energy source a key piece of its overall decarbonization strategy.
Estonia plans to build a small modular reactor (SMR) to wean itself off the addiction to pollutingoil shale and meet its target of producing 100% decarbonised electricity by 2030. A vote in Parliament is expected in the first half of 2024, officials say.Antti Tooming, deputy undersecretary of the Ministry of Climate and head of the working group, told the press in December that nuclear energy has the potential to ensure a stable energy supply in Estonia for future generations.In an interview with Energy Intelligence, he explained that the nuclear programme supports our ambitions towards the 2050 climate neutrality goal. Moreover, it helps us to achieve electricity security in Estonia, so we can cover our own electricity needs with electricity produced in Estonia.Reelika Runnel, coordinator of the Estonian Nuclear Energy Working Group, told Euractiv that the report will be discussed within the government, where decisions will be taken on how to formulate the decision in principle on the potential use of nuclear energy.The Estonian Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Monday (15 January) in front of the Riigikogu (State Assembly of Estonia) that government discussions would take place either this week or next week.The official date for the vote on this bill has not yet been set, but the coordinator suggested that the Parliament will be ready to take a decision on the potential deployment of nuclear power in Estonia in the form of SMR, in the first half of 2024.Until now, Estonias energy independence was ensured by the exploitation of oil shale, one of the most polluting fossil fuels. This sedimentary rock can be burnt as a low-grade fuel for power generation and heating.Oil shale provided nearly half of primary energy in 2021 but due to the energy crisis, the share increased to 57% in 2022, explained Andrei Belyi, adjunct professor in energy law and policy at the University of Eastern Finland and CEO of Estonian energy consulting firm Balesene O.But for Antti Tooming, the development of renewable energies cannot be the only solution: Theres always not all the time wind and not all the time sun, and we dont yet have the technology for storage of electricity in that amount. We need a specific amount of dispatchable energy.Kalev Kallemets, CEO of Firmi Energia, a company set up in 2019 to promote SMR technology in Estonia, explained in emailed replies to Euractiv that the programme is now targeting two 300 MWe units, for a total of 600 MWe of electricity production and remote heat production.The technology chosen is the BWRX-300 reactor developed by GE Hitachi, according to a press statement released in February last year by Firmi Energia. The first prototype of this model is expected to be built in Canada and has also been selected by PKN Orlen in Poland for part of its planned fleet of 74 SMRs.Socio-economic impact analyses have been carried out for the remaining 15 regions, Runnel explained. As a result, it was recommended that first consideration should be given to establishing a nuclear power plant in four regions, one of which is located in western Estonia and the other three on the northern coast, he told Euractiv.It has been concluded that, given the small size of Estonia, the location of the SMR is not of major importance. However, if the plant is located less than 50 km from the Russian border, additional safety considerations must be taken into account.The industry currently provides a livelihood for around 40% of the population in the Estonian region of Ida-Virumaa near the Russian border, contributing almost half to its GDP. The end of the shale industry could lead to the economic isolation of this mostly Russian-speaking region.The plan provides for investment in solar, wind and hydro power, as well as renewable hydrogen, and supports the development of renewable heating solutions. It also includes the restoration of contaminated brownfield sites, the Commission said, adding this will help create around 1,100 direct jobs for the region.The SMR project could be built on the site of a former oil shale site, thus providing access to a workforce with industrial experience, as well as attracting managers and higher white-collar professions to revitalise the region.The project is not consensual. Kadri Simson, the EUs energy commissioner who hails from Estonia, has expressed scepticism about the project, saying the countrys energy needs could be met with a better interconnected electricity market without requiring each EU country to build its own nuclear plant.Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas herself acknowledged that nuclear energy has pros and cons, without elaborating. In the sense that there has to be a popular consensus on this, I think that is absolutely correct, the prime minister told the Estonian assembly, according to public broadcaster ERR.
Think back to 1986 and 2011. If youre a seasoned uranium futures trader, you will know the significance of these years, although most people wont have a clue. If the current trend in uranium continues, 2024 could be another historic year for a commodity thats usually under the radar but is suddenly popping up in the headlines.To recap, the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown took place in Russia (the Soviet Union, at that time) in 1986, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster occurred in Japan in 2011. Those two terrible incidents gave nuclear energy a bad rap, as the saying goes.We can debate all day long whether this bad rap is deserved or not, but todays focus will be on investment opportunities. Is there value now in recently explosive uranium stocks? Thats the billion-dollar question, so lets start by taking stock of recent moves in the spot uranium price, which will naturally affect all uranium-market stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024.To understand whats going on in the sphere of uranium and nuclear energy, youll have to look outside of North America. It wont be much of a pleasure trip, but when conducting your due diligence, you have to go wherever the action is.Our first stopover will be in France, which hasnt traditionally been amenable to nuclear-power proliferation. Indeed, France has been among the vanguard nations that promote solar, wind and other clean-energy sources.However, France may be on the cusp of redefining clean energy sources to include nuclear power. Tough times require a certain measure of flexibility, but Frances recent about-face concerning nuclear energy is practically unheard of.Believe it or not, a high-profile pro-nuclear bill is currently working its way through the French governments highest levels. The bill would provide for six to 14 new nuclear reactors and promotes the sustainable choice of usingnuclear energyas a competitive and carbon-free electricity source.Theres no guarantee that this bill will become the law of the land, but its a sign that governments in Europe and elsewhere may turn to nuclear power to shore up their energy independence. Yet, while global demand for uranium may soon be on the rise, its the supply side of the equation thats really sending the spot uranium price soaring.Now its time to visit Eastern Europes Kazakhstan, where NAC Kazatomprom, the largest producer of uranium on the planet, warned that it will be difficult to achieve its 2024 and 2025 goals for uranium production. The company didnt update its production guidance, but it did observe challenges in sourcing the necessary sulfuric acid to extract uranium.Thus, weve learned two things on our unusual two-stop jaunt. First, the global demand for uranium could increase if typically reluctant governments change their stances on nuclear power. Second, a key uranium producer probably wont meet its previously stated production targets.These factors were evidently enough to push the spot uranium price above $100 not long ago. The exact price is a constantly moving target, but uranium watchers lit up social media on Monday with breathy posts like this one:When it comes to buying commodity-related stocks and ETFs, whats more important than how is the question of how much. Im certainly not against the idea of buying uranium stocks and funds now, but any and all position sizes should be very small.Consequently, investors might consider starting off with a few shares of the Global X Uranium ETF (NYSEARCA:URA) and the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:URNM) for general uranium-market exposure. To that, they can add a handful of shares of Canada-based Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) and U.S.-headquartered Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC).Disclaimer: All investments involve risk.

In this article, we take a look at the 15 worst industrial disasters in the world. If you want to, you can skip our detailed robotics industry analysis and go directly to our shorter list of the 5 worst industrial disasters in the world.Industrial disasters are accidents that occur in industrial companies due to failure, negligence, or incompetence in handling chemical, mechanical, civil, electrical, or other processes. Since an industrial disaster involves dangerous chemicals and hazardous substances, it is a significant threat not just to humans, but also to the natural and infrastructural environment.Today, the industrial sector takes up a large portion of the world economy, making up 17.9% of the GDP of the United States, which is the largest economy in the world as of 2024. Over the decades, the industrial sector has maintained its position in the world economy. A detailed analysis of this conducted by the Industrial Analytics Platform further emphasizes the close link between industrial activities, economic growth, and sustainable development, and how industrial development will take a whole new level in the years to come.Given the importance of the industrial sector, it is also important to note that if the balance is tipped, there can be a significant impact on the world economy. Throughout history, weve seen multiple times how industrial disasters trigger huge economic losses and destabilize sustainable growth.Industrial disasters concern not just the manufacturing industries, but others as well. In 2022, the chemical industrys total revenue, on a global level, stood at around USD 5.72 trillion, reaching the highest value in the last 15 years. The chemical industry is growing at an exponential rate, but a minor negligence or failure involving chemicals like in the Bhopal Gas Tragedy can lead to a catastrophe.Similar to the chemical industry, the nuclear industry, which is responsible for generating 10% of the worlds electricity according to the World Nuclear Association, is also prone to disasters. For instance, in 2011, the Fukushima disaster in Japan was an eye-opener for many countries with nuclear energy plants. It dealt a heavy blow to Japan's economy, with its share of nuclear energy dropping from 29.2% in 2010-11 to 2.1% in 2012.Fortunately, the industrial sector continues to learn from past disasters and implement more safety precautions to safeguard the future. As world technology progresses, industrial workplace safety is enhanced and the risk of disasters is also minimized. One of the most effective solutions has been the incorporation of robotics technology as it can perform repetitive tasks faster and with much higher accuracy and precision than human workers.For the same reason, using robots and automating industrial manufacturing has been a growing trend in recent years. In 2023, there were around 4.09 million units of service robotics and 450 thousand units of industrial robots worldwide. (See: 15 Biggest Robotics Companies in the World). While human workers are still needed in industrial manufacturing, robots and machines can be used to handle hazardous chemicals and dangerous tasks to minimize industrial disasters.Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, economic growth has mainly come at the expense of the environment. While economies, populations, and resource demands grow continuously, the availability of resources remains the same, therefore urging industrial companies to adopt strategies in the modern world to uplift economies without exhausting natural resources.From human-centered processes to machine-reliant assembly lines to highly automated factories, industrial companies are adapting to new trends and transforming their methods. Some of the main reasons for adapting to new trends are to minimize the risk of disasters, improve efficiency, lower costs, and reduce material wastage.Some industrial companies are already incorporating Industry 4.0 in their manufacturing processes. For instance, HIROTEC Corporation, a major automotive supplier, uses the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for operational intelligence and predicting maintenance in its manufacturing machines and assets.Some of the key players in the manufacturing companies are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM), Samsung Electronics (KSE: 005930), and BASF SE (ETR: BAS). All these industrial companies are well-aligned with Industry 4.0 and use it in their process management. In fact, in 2017, Apple partnered with GE to bring iOS into Industry 4. In 2023, Apple took more initiatives including the first Smart Manufacturing Forum for SMBs in South Korea, to showcase its serious involvement in the fourth industrial revolution.Over the years, Apple has invested millions of dollars in automation technology, and it is not the only one. Today, all industrial companies are prioritizing technology and development to reduce the risk of disasters and become the key players in their sector. At the same time, they acknowledge that automation technology cannot replace the skill of human workers even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) did, in their conversation with The Information.For our list of the worst industrial disasters in the world, we analyzed a list of notable industrial disasters in the world and shortlisted the ones that incurred the most damage to human life and/or the economy. We ranked disasters based on the number of deaths caused by the disaster, going from the least to the highest. Weve also discussed financial and industrial losses caused by each disaster.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Still, many people were injured. This disaster took place in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, near the M1 motorway.The aftermath included a hefty cleanup, destroyed properties, and around 1 billion in damage. Total UK, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, and the British Pipeline Agency (BPA) were all fined after this disaster.On 10 July 1976, a chemical reactor exploded in the ICMESA plant located near Seveso, Italy. The disaster killed 3,000 farm animals immediately and left people with terrible health disorders. The explosion caused dioxins to leak into the area.While no human lives were lost as a result of the explosion, over 70,000 animals were euthanized to make sure no one would get harmed by the chemicals. To this day, the Seveso area is off-limits for any development.In the aftermath of this disaster, Seveso experienced financial consequences due to environmental damage, decreased property value, livestock loss, and agricultural loss. Healthcare costs also increased because of skin diseases caused by chemicals.The Deepwater Horizon Explosion of 2010 is known as one of the most significant oil spills and one of the worst industrial disasters in history. As a result of this disaster, 11 people lost their lives and 17 got severely injured.The Deepwater Horizon rig is owned by BP PLC (NYSE: BP), a leading oil company. According to a report published by BP, the explosion was a result of many causes all of which contributed to a wellhead explosion, the release of natural gas, and its eventual ignition at the rig. After the explosion, 1000 barrels of oil leaked into the ocean daily for 85.5 days.BP had to pay compensation of $20 million to the victims and families of those who lost their loved ones. A lot of damage was caused by this explosion, including thousands of marine animals dying. This explosion also left many people unemployed due to the lack of tourism in the petroleum-laden areas.Another tragic chemical explosion, the Texas city refinery disaster, was the result of a vapor cloud of chemicals catching on fire. One hundred eighty workers were heavily injured, and 15 lost their lives. This took place at a BP refinery in Texas when a vapor cloud exploded in its isomerization process unit.BP PLC (NYSE: BP) was sued for an environmental crime and charged a $50 million fine. BP PLC (NYSE: BP) also had to pay around $1.6 billion to compensate the victims. These continued until 2009 when OSHA charged BP a whopping $87 million fine.The deadly Phillips Disaster took place in 1989 when high-flammable gasses caused multiple explosions at the Phillips Petroleum Company (NYSE: PSX). Twenty-three people were killed and 314 were injured. The fire lasted for 10 hours, damaging water pipes and making it harder to put out.The Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is one of the most known industrial disasters and even inspired a $40 million show by HBO. The miniseries depicted the atrocities of the disaster and helped create awareness regarding industrial disasters. It is available to watch on Apple TV+(NASDAQ: AAPL) as well. The disaster took 50 lives and has left the entire area radioactive and inhabitable to this day. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone will be habitable again in 20,000 years.In April 1986, an explosion occurred at a Chernobyl nuclear plant. Perhaps the worst nuclear disaster to ever exist, over $68 billion was spent to help with migration. Chernobyl is still radioactive, although some residents have returned to their homes.There was a direct loss of $12.6 billion on the economic side. Around 784,320 hectares of land were destroyed, and food production in the area was banned. The disaster also caused significant electrical loss in places like Ukraine.The Xiangshui chemical plant produced chemicals such as pesticides and other organic compounds and has since shut down. Like the other disasters mentioned on this list, the plant ignored waste management and safety regulations warnings. Not only did they choose to ignore them, but there had also been previous fires at this plant.In March 2019, an explosion took place, killing 78 people and destroying buildings nearby. The Xiangshui chemical plant was shut down soon after, and the district faces a property loss of around $100 million. There was also an economic loss of about $284.3 million.The Centralia Mine Disaster is known as the second-worst mining disaster in the US, killing over 100 people. It took place in Centralia, Pennsylvania on 25 March 1947. The disaster started off with the electricity being cut off and thick black smoke surging through the mines. This then led to a large accumulation of smoke and a deadly explosion.Poor safety regulations and coal dust caused this tragic explosion. Out of 142 men, only 31 managed to escape. The mine had received previous warnings about the coal dust that was collecting, but they chose to ignore it.Some economic consequences faced after this disaster were compensation for victims, recovery investments, and safety regulations. According to a report by the UN, there was a temporary decline in coal production after the disaster.The Beirut explosion is one of the most recent industrial disasters caused by an ammonium nitrate explosion in the capital of Lebanon. There were more than 200 deaths and 7000 injuries resulting from the incident which took place in 2020. This explosion was the cause of large amounts of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse without proper security measures. Lebanese authorities believe that welding work was what resulted in a fire which then led to the explosion.While some time has passed, Beirut still hasn't recovered from the explosion. Not only did this disaster weaken the local currency and push millions into poverty, but it also wrecked necessary infrastructure like ports. The economic loss caused by this incident was around $15 billion, with $3 billion going into infrastructure restoration. With the port destroyed, there was a lack of exports and imports, which the country relied on.In December 2003, PetroChinas Chuandongbei natural gas field exploded in the municipality of Chongqing, China, killing more than 233 people and injuring over 10,000, putting it sixth on our list of the worst industrial disasters in the world. The blast was at such a catastrophic level that it nearly wiped out an entire village and caused other widespread damages.While there isnt much information about how much PetroChina (HKSE: 0857) paid compensation regarding this case, there most likely would have been rescuing operation costs, property damages, and compensation for blast victims.
The Council of EU member states and the European Parliament agreed on Tuesday (6 February) to label nuclear power as a strategic technology for the EUs decarbonisation, following months of intense negotiations in Brussels over the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA).It came in response to the massive US green subsidy programme, the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as long-standing Chinese efforts to become global leaders in the manufacturing of clean technologies like batteries, heat pumps and solar panels.To this end, the NZIA aims to accelerate permitting procedures for industrial production sites involved in the manufacturing of components needed for renewable energy technologies, but also for nuclear power.Meeting in trilogues, negotiators from the Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission confirmed on Tuesday the strategic nature of projects relating to nuclear energy, which are included in a single list of net-zero technologies that will benefit from the NZIA.The text is a mix of the two mandates [adopted by the Council and Parliament], with a more comprehensive list than what was proposed by the member states, explained French MEP Christophe Grudler who took part in the talks for the centrist Renew Europe group in Parliament.The agreement encompasses tried and tested nuclear technologies as well as future third and fourth generation ones, i.e. small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced nuclear reactors (AMRs). Their fuel cycles are also included in the text.While supporters of nuclear power in France have welcomed plans to scrap the two-tier approach to low-carbon technologies in the EUs draft Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), they also condemn the lower status granted to atomic energy as incoherent with the blocs wider decarbonisation goals.Concretely, this means that factories producing components for these technologies will benefit from simplified permitting procedures, with deadlines ranging from 18 to 12 months for bigger projects and 12 to nine months for smaller ones.The situation caused uproar among advocates of nuclear power after European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen publicly insisted that nuclear power was not strategic. In Paris, these were dismissed as unfortunate comments.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen outlined limits to EU backing for nuclear power under the blocs Net-Zero Industry Act, which seeks to support home-made production of clean technologies like batteries and solar panels.After much back and forth, nuclear power was finally included in the single list of 17 technologies proposed in November by the texts rapporteur, German MEP Christian Ehler (European Peoples Party  EPP).
A group of residents of towns near Japanese nuclear plants submitted a petition on Friday asking regulators to halt safety screening for the restart of idled reactors until damage to a plant that partially lost external power and spilled radioactive water during a recent powerful earthquake is fully examined.Two idled reactors at Shika nuclear power plant on the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa suffered power outages because of damage to transformers. Radioactive water spilled from spent fuel cooling pools and cracks appeared on the ground, but no radiation leaked outside, operator Hokuriku Electric Power Co. said.All Japanese nuclear power plants were temporarily shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster for safety checks under stricter standards. The government is pushing for them to be restarted but the process has been slow, in part because of lingering anti-nuclear sentiment among the public. Twelve of the 33 workable reactors have since restarted.Residents of Ishikawa and other towns with nuclear plants gathered in Tokyo on Friday and handed their petition to officials at the Nuclear Regulation Authority. They are asking officials to freeze the screening process while damage at the Shika nuclear plant is fully examined and safety measures are implemented.Nuclear safety officials have noted that the extensive damage suffered by houses and roads in the area of the Shika plant make current evacuation plans largely unworkable. The damage, including landslides, made many places inaccessible, trapping thousands of people on the narrow peninsula.Takako Nakagaki, a resident of Kanazawa, about 60 kilometers (35 miles) south of the Shika plant, said the current evacuation plan is pie in the sky. Under the plan, residents closer to the plant are advised to stay indoors in case of a radiation leak, but that would be impossible if houses are damaged in an earthquake.The Noto quake also sparked fear in neighboring Fukui prefecture, where seven reactors at three plants have restarted, and in Niigata prefecture, where the operator of the tsunami-hit Fukushima nuclear plant is preparing to restart its only workable nuclear plant, the worlds largest seven-reactor Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant.The Nuclear Regulation Authority has requested a further investigation of the Shika plant, even though initial assessments showed no immediate risk to its cooling functions or outside radiation leaks. NRA officials said Shikas operator should consider the possibility of additional damage to key equipment as aftershocks continue.The Shika reactors, inaugurated in 1993 and 2006, have been offline since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Hokuriku Electric Power has expressed hopes to restart the newer No. 2 reactor by 2026, but reviews of the recent quake damage could delay that plan.Join us for a webinar on how hair is represented in anime, presented by a teacher from Anime Artist Academy.

Attendance is free but only 50 spots are available.Japan, inc. have shown for decades they will do things their way, meaning ways that continue to maximize their control and that profit them the most. The public continues to vote in politicians that support highly centralized energy systems, and apparently are willing to pay for those systems, whose costs increasingly rise. Nuclear power costs are too often hidden and/or fudged; the externalities of nuke power and burning huge amounts of fossil fuels are rarely revealed by those in power. Find ways to assist individual property owners to make their properties more energy efficient, and find ways to generate electricity that are renewable and do as little harm to the environment as possible. Let individuals and local areas have more control over choices, instead of bureaucrats and politicians in TokyoEven this article does mention all the things that we already know went wrong on that day (and have not yet been fixed) at Shika. The 4-meter high sea wall for example subsided and tilted under repeated 3-meter tsunami hits, and not far away tsunami waves are shown to have reached higher than that.That is 100% not true. Communities with nuclear power plants receive contributions from the power companies which are supposed to be used for various matters like evacuations. It is also used to improve the community.Join us for a webinar on how hair is represented in anime, presented by a teacher from Anime Artist Academy.

Nuclear fission was once seen as the future. In the early 1960s, politicians and scientists in Germany thought that it would provide an endless supply of electricity, without polluting the air. There was little discussion of the risks of nuclear accidents.Heinz Smital, an atomic energy expert atGreenpeace, told DW that politicians at the time were euphoric: "From the very beginning, nuclear energy benefited from the fact that countries were interested in the technology, because of nuclear weapons. The energy companies weren't interested in getting into nuclear power. The interest came from the national level."Jochen Flasbarth, the current State Secretary in the Ministry of Development, adds: "In the 1960s, Germany was still in 'economic miracle' mode. There was an enormous, almost nave faith in technology."At the time, much of the air in Germany was dirty, and the sky was often clouded with smog, especially in the heavily industrialized western Ruhr region, home to much of the country's steel and coal industry. Coal-burning power plants were a significant source of electricity. Nuclear energy was a clear alternative, promising "clean" energy.Similar thinking took hold in the former East Germany, where the first commercial nuclear power plant went online in 1961. It was a time of confidence in the technology on both sides of the Iron Curtain. In the following years, a total of 37 nuclear reactors went into operation in Germany.Attitudes changed in the 1970s. Protesters from the growing environmentalist movement demonstrated at the construction sites of new power plants. "The anti-nuclear movement emerged in part as a protest by young people against their largely apolitical parents," says Jochen Flasbarth. "This culminated in big anti-nuclear demonstrations."In 1979, the Three Mile Island power plant in the US suffered the world's worst nuclear accident at the time, narrowly averting a nuclear disaster. Steffi Lemke of the Green Party, the current Federal Environment Minister, says, "Nuclear euphoria increasingly gave way to the realization that nuclear energy is not something [we can] control."Then came the Chernobyl accident, in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. On April 26, 1986, a reactor meltdown set a major nuclear accident in motion. The area is still contaminated  and the political fallout continues to this day.Chernobyl contributed to growing skepticism about nuclear energy in Germany. "The construction of power plants collapsed after that. There were plans for 60 nuclear power plants in Germany alone," said Heinz Smital of Greenpeace.In 1980, the Green Party emerged from the anti-nuclear movement. Shutting down nuclear reactors was a core part of its program. In 1983, the party entered the Bundestag. In 1998, the Greens became part of a governing coalition for the first time, joining the Social Democrats (SPD). The two parties moved to phase out nuclear energy, against fierce resistance from the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), who later called for a "phase-out of the phase-out.Since then, the CDU and CSU have changed their position on nuclear power again. Now many in the party are calling for new reactors to be built. CDU leaderFriedrich Merz has said that shutting down the last reactors was a "black day for Germany."The parties also say that old reactors should be reconnected to the grid. Merz says that the country should restart the last three power plants that were shut down  citing climate protection, as well as rising oil and gas prices.Environment Minister Steffi Lemke is not surprised. "The energy companies made adjustments a long time ago, and they still reject nuclear power in Germany today. Nuclear power is a high-risk technology whose radioactive waste will continue to be toxic for thousands of years, and will be an issue for many generations."There are currently 412 reactors in use worldwide, spread across 32 countries. Even as new reactors are built, older ones are shut down, so the overall number has remained more or less constant for years. Countries such as China, France and the UK have announced new construction. Others want to build small, modern reactors.According to Greenpeace's Smital, the small reactors are focused on military use, rather than energy production. "One of them is in North Korea. It produces the fuel for the country's whole nuclear weapons program. Economic efficiency is not the point. I see a great danger in these small, often mobile reactors."The authorities have to look for suitable sites, make selections and commission test drillings. Local communities, who don't want nuclear waste buried anywhere near them, often resist. And figuring out costs and timelines is difficult."I can't estimate any of this at the moment," says Dagmar Dehmer of the government's nuclear waste disposal agency. "We have to look at several regions. Drilling costs millions. The evaluation alone costs about five million euros."Environment Minister Lemke believes economic viability will decide. "No power company would build a nuclear plant in Germany, because the costs would be far too high. Nuclear power plants can only be built with massive public and hidden subsidies, including partial exemption from insurance requirements."
So far this week, spot prices for yellowcake - uranium concentrate used in nuclear power generation - reached a new 16-year high, climbing to $92.45 per pound. Reflecting on our December 2020 note to readers in "Buy Uranium: Is This The Beginning Of The Next ESG Craze," yellowcake prices have risen 217%.BofA's metals and mining team said tightness in uranium markets could extend well into 2025, indicating that prices could run higher through this year. The team of analysts has increased their uranium spot price price targets to $105 per pound in 2024 and $115 in 2025.On a separate note, Berenberg analysts said the requirement for some uranium users to diversify away from Russian supply could be a major price driver. They said prices will likely normalize around $70 per pound for the long term.Soaring prices have buoyed stocks of mining companies like Cameco up nearly 300% since December 2020. The Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM is also up almost 300%. And supplier Uranium Energy Corp is up 416%.

South Korea plans to build the world's largest semiconductor cluster in Gyeonggi Province by investing around $470 billion (430 billion) over the next 23 years into the massive production park in partnership with major electronics companies Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix.To support the plan, the government has proposed measures including tax incentives for investments and initiatives to boost competitiveness. South Korea aims to increase self-sufficiency in essential materials, parts, and equipment for chip production to 50% by 2030.South Korea currently dominates the production of DRAM and NAND memory chips, which are used for managing and storing data on devices on PCs, smartphones and SD cards, holding a global market share of over 60%. South Korea aims to increase its share of other chips and processors.Samsung also seeks to overtake the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) leading position producing wafers, which are thin disks made up of semiconducting material, mainly silicon, that act as the first layer in creating semiconductor components.President Yoon Suk-yeol has said that the ambitious "mega cluster" is expected to generate nearly 3.5 million jobs. To achieve this, he emphasized the necessity of expanding nuclear energy to meet the energy demands of the semiconductor sector.A semiconductor "cluster" is a group of facilities that perform research and all production steps of semiconductors all in a single area. South Korea's cluster comprises various industrial zones in the province of Gyeonggi, with a total area of 21,000 hectares (52,000 acres), which is 21 million square meters, or the size of almost 30,000 soccer fields."If we complete the construction of the semiconductor mega cluster at an earlier date, we will achieve the world's leading competitiveness in the chip sector and provide quality jobs for young generations," said trade and industry minister Ahn Duk-geun.Samsung Electronics is set to invest 500 trillion won ($375 billion) in the project, allocating 360 trillion won for six new production facilities in Yongin, located 33 kilometers (20 miles) south of Seoul.Additionally, 120 trillion won will be directed towards building three new factories in the Pyeongtaek production complex, situated 54 kilometers south of Seoul, along with three research factories in Giheung.South Korea sees its chip industry at risk of losing importance in the power struggle between China and the USA. In 2022, South Korea exported semiconductor goods worth $129 billion, which accounted for around 19% of national exports.A reduction in national production would hit South Korea's economy hard. "Korea is at the forefront of semiconductors, which creates economic opportunities but also makes companies vulnerable," said Troy Stangarone from the Korea Economic Institute in Washington.The US is promoting the establishment of semiconductor production facilities with subsidies of $52.7 billion with the "CHIPS and Science Act." This is why Samsung is building a $17 billion chip plant in the US state of Texas.At the same time, a new cluster of TSMC and Sony processor plants is being built on the main Japanese island of Kyushu. Meanwhile, OpenAI boss Sam Altmann is looking for producers of chips for the development and application of artificial intelligence.Thanks to an indefinite special permit, South Korean manufacturers have so far been exempt from US restrictions and are allowed to export equipment and machinery to China. The Samsung plant for NAND memory chips in Xian and SK Hynix's NAND factory in Dalian benefit from this.However, South Korean doubts about production in China are growing. On January 24, SK Hynix had to deny again that it was planning to sell the plant in Dalian, which it had only taken over from Intel for $9 billion in December 2020.According to market researcher Bloomberg Intelligence, the US controls five of the ten stages of the chip supply and production chain, including etching, coating and doping, while Japan and the Netherlands control the remaining areas, such as wafer cleaning and lithography.Thus, South Korea's key role as a chip manufacturer depends on technologies, materials and expertise mainly belonging to the US and its allies. South Korean manufacturers are therefore focusing on cooperation with US companies to strengthen their national production.
In late 2022, U.S. industrial leader Dow Inc partnered with Rockville, Maryland-based advanced nuclear developer X-energy to demonstrate a high-temperature gas reactor (HTGR) for industrial decarbonization. Dow, with $57 billion in annual net sales, has a stated objective of carbon neutrality along its entire value chain by 2050. The Dow X-energy nuclear cogeneration project, at the Seadrift facility in Texas, is part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, which seeks to de-risk advanced reactors through cost-shared partnerships with private industry. Having begun in 2021, ARDP plans to invest $1.23 billion in this project over seven years.Dows vision is to eventually produce zero-carbon plastic, as the need for such solutions is growing. For example, after two years of research, Danish toymaker Lego recently determined that recycling plastic bottles into toy bricks would increase GHG emissions. As society starts to account for the embedded carbon content of various products, Dow aims to realize premium pricing by selling low-carbon plastic. Dow had a Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG footprint of 31.5 million tonnes CO2e in 2022, from 104 manufacturing facilities across 31 countries.Dows Seadrift is the companys second largest facility in Texas, spanning 4,700 acres and employing more than 1,200 people in Calhoun County. Seadrift annually produces 1,816 tonnes of material for food packaging and preservation, footwear, wire and cable insulation, solar cell membranes, and packaging for medical and pharmaceutical products. Co-locating a nuclear cogeneration plant at this energy consumer facility allows for the efficient utilization of produced heat.Proponents of the Seadrift project estimate that nuclear repowering will reduce annual GHG emissions by 440,000 tonnes CO2e, totaling 1.4% of Dows Scope 1 and 2 corporate emissions. The Seadrift site currently uses combined cycle gas steam turbines with 156 MWe capacity. Installed in 2000, this cogeneration asset is nearing scheduled retirement age by 2030, when it will be replaced with nuclear. Construction is planned to start in 2026.The Xe-100 reactor can provide 80 megawatts of electric power (MWe) from 200 MW of thermal output (MWth), and is expected have a 60-year operational life. The Xe-100 also can deliver high-temperature steam of 565C to serve a variety of industries including mining, chemical production, and petroleum refining. Four Xe-100 reactors will be deployed on a 26-acre footprint at Seadrift. Reliability is of paramount concern to Dow; the facility has not had an unplanned steam outage since 1987. While Seadrift needs only 100 MWe electricity plus 200 MWth heat, Dow is purchasing four reactors to accommodate for planned and unplanned maintenance, plus backup. In the future, Dow aims to both expand Seadrift operations and sell excess carbon-free power to the grid. In September 2023, the Public Utility Commission of Texas established the Texas Advanced Nuclear Reactor Working Group to study advances in this technology, the supply chain development, and the changes needed the electric grid operator.Dow is an optimal industrial leader to pioneer U.S. nuclear cogeneration. The company is well regarded for its operational excellence in cogeneration. Energy accounts for a large part of the companys costs, and Dow attracts and retains the expertise necessary to see complicated projects through. In November 2023, Dow embarked on building the worlds first Scope 1 and 2 net-zero ethylene and derivatives complex at Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. The $6.5 billion Path2Zero investment project aims to use air separation and autothermal reforming to convert the sites cracker off-gas to hydrogen and also capture and store 1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.Chopping, D.

The vendor hasn't submitted the design license request yet, but is in pre-licensing engagement. In December 2023, NRC approved Kairos Power's 35 MW molten salt rest reactor within 18 months. This was the first high-temp license reactor license approved since 1968. In July 2023, Kairos also submitted an approval request for Hermes 2, a two-unit demonstration plant at the same site. Hermes 2 is expected to be operational in 2028.3) While solar thermal generates heat, solar PV and wind do not. Generating heat through electricity is extremely inefficient and expensive (especially at the temperatures required at facilities such as this). Adding storage to operate to this would diminish any economic viability beyond that. Dow requires 99.7% uptime for process steam for the Seadrift plant.If you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it. It's also easy to share a link to an article you've liked or an industry resource that you think would be helpful.
