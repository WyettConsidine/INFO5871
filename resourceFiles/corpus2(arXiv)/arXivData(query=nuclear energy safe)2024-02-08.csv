"A civil super-Manhattan project in nuclear research for a safer and
  prosperous world","  Humankind is confronted with a ""nuclear stewardship curse"", facing the prospect of needing to manage nuclear products over long time scales in the face of the short-time scales of human polities. I propose a super Manhattan-type effort to rejuvenate the nuclear energy industry to overcome the current dead-end in which it finds itself, and by force, humankind has trapped itself in. A 1% GDP investment over a decade in the main nuclear countries could boost economic growth with a focus on the real world, epitomised by nuclear physics/chemistry/engineering/economics with well defined targets. By investing vigorously to obtain scientific and technological breakthroughs, we can create the spring of a world economic rebound based on new ways of exploiting nuclear energy, both more safely and more durably.

Molten-Salt Depleted-Uranium Reactor,"  The supercritical, reactor core melting and nuclear fuel leaking accidents have troubled fission reactors for decades, and greatly limit their extensive applications. Now these troubles are still open. Here we first show a possible perfect reactor, Molten-Salt Depleted-Uranium Reactor which is no above accident trouble. We found this reactor could be realized in practical applications in terms of all of the scientific principle, principle of operation, technology, and engineering. Our results demonstrate how these reactors can possess and realize extraordinary excellent characteristics, no prompt critical, long-term safe and stable operation with negative feedback, closed uranium-plutonium cycle chain within the vessel, normal operation only with depleted-uranium, and depleted-uranium high burnup in reality, to realize with fission nuclear energy sufficiently satisfying humanity long-term energy resource needs, as well as thoroughly solve the challenges of nuclear criticality safety, uranium resource insufficiency and low-carbon development. They could provide safe, cheap, abundant, and clean energy resource and electric power lasting thousands years for humanity. ",
Nanoscale Oxygen Defect Gradients in the Actinide Oxides,"  Oxygen defects govern the behavior of a range of materials spanning catalysis, quantum computing, and nuclear energy. Understanding and controlling these defects is particularly important for the safe use, storage, and disposal of actinide oxides in the nuclear fuel cycle, since their oxidation state influences fuel lifetimes, stability, and the contamination of groundwater. However, poorly understood nanoscale fluctuations in these systems can lead to significant deviations from bulk oxidation behavior. Here we describe the first use of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy to resolve changes in the local oxygen defect environment in UO$_2$ surfaces. We observe large image contrast and spectral changes that reflect the presence of sizable gradients in interstitial oxygen content at the nanoscale, which we quantify through first principles calculations and image simulations. These findings reveal an unprecedented level of excess oxygen incorporated in a complex near-surface spatial distribution, offering new insight into defect formation pathways and kinetics during UO$_2$ oxidation.

Energy Realpolitik: Towards a Sustainable Energy Strategy,"  A long-term strategy based on existing technological, ecological, economical, and geopolitical realities is urgently needed to develop a sustainable energy economy, which should be designed with adaptability to unpredicted changes in any of these aspects. While only a highly diverse energy portfolio and conservation can ultimately guarantee optimum sustainability, based on a comparison of current primary energy generation methods, it is argued that future energy strategy has to rely heavily on expanded coal and nuclear energy sectors. A comparison of relative potentials, merits and risks associated with fossil-fuel, renewable, and nuclear technologies suggests that the balance of technologies should be shifted in favor of new-generation, safe nuclear methods to produce electricity, while clean-coal plants should be assigned to transportation fuel. Novel nuclear technologies exploit fission of uranium and thorium as primary energy sources with fast-spectrum and transmutation (burner) reactors. A closed fuel cycle and waste transmutation resolve the strategic issues associated with nuclear power. Innovative reactor designs utilize spallation of heavy metals in subcritical accelerator driven systems or molten-salt reactors. Importation and reconstruction of technical expertise already lost and aversion of further erosion are preconditions to any successful energy strategy. Research opportunities to perfect innovative nuclear, coal, and renewable energy technologies should be pursued. ",
"Reinforcement learning for Energies of the future and carbon neutrality:
  a Challenge Design","  Current rapid changes in climate increase the urgency to change energy production and consumption management, to reduce carbon and other green-house gas production. In this context, the French electricity network management company RTE (R{\'e}seau de Transport d'{\'E}lectricit{\'e}) has recently published the results of an extensive study outlining various scenarios for tomorrow's French power management. We propose a challenge that will test the viability of such a scenario. The goal is to control electricity transportation in power networks, while pursuing multiple objectives: balancing production and consumption, minimizing energetic losses, and keeping people and equipment safe and particularly avoiding catastrophic failures. While the importance of the application provides a goal in itself, this challenge also aims to push the state-of-the-art in a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) called Reinforcement Learning (RL), which offers new possibilities to tackle control problems. In particular, various aspects of the combination of Deep Learning and RL called Deep Reinforcement Learning remain to be harnessed in this application domain. This challenge belongs to a series started in 2019 under the name ""Learning to run a power network"" (L2RPN). In this new edition, we introduce new more realistic scenarios proposed by RTE to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, retiring fossil fuel electricity production, increasing proportions of renewable and nuclear energy and introducing batteries. Furthermore, we provide a baseline using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm to stimulate the future participants. ",
"The impact of the surface energy coefficient on the deformation
  properties of atomic nuclei as predicted by Skyrme energy density functionals","  In the framework of nuclear energy density functional (EDF) methods, many nuclear phenomena are related to the deformation of intrinsic states. Their accurate modeling relies on the correct description of the change of nuclear binding energy with deformation. The two most important contributions to the deformation energy have their origin in shell effects that are correlated to the spectrum of single-particle states, and the deformability of nuclear matter, that can be characterized by a model-dependent surface energy coefficient a_{surf}.   With the goal of improving the global performance of nuclear EDFs through fine-tuning of their deformation properties, the purpose of this study is threefold. First, to analyze the impact of systematic variations of a_{surf} on properties of nuclei; second, to identify observables that can be safely used to narrow down the range of appropriate values of a_{surf} to be targeted in future parameter fits; third, to analyze the interdependence of a_{surf} with other properties of a nuclear EDF.   Results for a large variety of relevant observables of deformed nuclei obtained from self-consistent mean-field calculations with a set of purpose-built SLy5sX parameterizations of the Skyrme EDF are correlated with the value of a_{surf}.   The three main conclusions are that there is an evident preference for a comparatively low value of a_{surf}, as expected from the performance of existing parameterizations; that the isospin dependence of the surface energy also needs further finetuning in order to describe trends across the chart of nuclei; and that a satisfying simultaneous description of fission barriers and superdeformed states requires a better description of the single-particle spectra.
