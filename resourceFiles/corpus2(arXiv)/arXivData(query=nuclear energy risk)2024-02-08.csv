"The Precautionary Principle (with Application to the Genetic
  Modification of Organisms)","  We present a non-naive version of the Precautionary (PP) that allows us to avoid paranoia and paralysis by confining precaution to specific domains and problems. PP is intended to deal with uncertainty and risk in cases where the absence of evidence and the incompleteness of scientific knowledge carries profound implications and in the presence of risks of ""black swans"", unforeseen and unforeseable events of extreme consequence. We formalize PP, placing it within the statistical and probabilistic structure of ruin problems, in which a system is at risk of total failure, and in place of risk we use a formal fragility based approach. We make a central distinction between 1) thin and fat tails, 2) Local and systemic risks and place PP in the joint Fat Tails and systemic cases. We discuss the implications for GMOs (compared to Nuclear energy) and show that GMOs represent a public risk of global harm (while harm from nuclear energy is comparatively limited and better characterized). PP should be used to prescribe severe limits on GMOs. ",

"Nuclear Energy Acceptance in Poland: From Societal Attitudes to
  Effective Policy Strategies -- Network Modeling Approach","  Poland is currently undergoing substantial transformation in its energy sector, and gaining public support is pivotal for the success of its energy policies. We conducted a study with 338 Polish participants to investigate societal attitudes towards various energy sources, including nuclear energy and renewables. Applying a novel network approach, we identified a multitude of factors influencing energy acceptance. Political ideology is the central factor in shaping public acceptance, however we also found that environmental attitudes, risk perception, safety concerns, and economic variables play substantial roles. Considering the long-term commitment associated with nuclear energy and its role in Poland's energy transformation, our findings provide a foundation for improving energy policy in Poland. Our research underscores the importance of policies that resonate with the diverse values, beliefs, and preferences of the population. While the risk-risk trade-off and technology-focused strategies are effective to a degree, we advocate for a more comprehensive approach. The framing strategy, which tailors messages to distinct societal values, shows particular promise. ",
"Determining feature importance for actionable climate change mitigation
  policies","  Given the importance of public support for policy change and implementation, public policymakers and researchers have attempted to understand the factors associated with this support for climate change mitigation policy. In this article, we compare the feasibility of using different supervised learning methods for regression using a novel socio-economic data set which measures public support for potential climate change mitigation policies. Following this model selection, we utilize gradient boosting regression, a well-known technique in the machine learning community, but relatively uncommon in public policy and public opinion research, and seek to understand what factors among the several examined in previous studies are most central to shaping public support for mitigation policies in climate change studies. The use of this method provides novel insights into the most important factors for public support for climate change mitigation policies. Using national survey data, we find that the perceived risks associated with climate change are more decisive for shaping public support for policy options promoting renewable energy and regulating pollutants. However, we observe a very different behavior related to public support for increasing the use of nuclear energy where climate change risk perception is no longer the sole decisive feature. Our findings indicate that public support for renewable energy is inherently different from that for nuclear energy reliance with the risk perception of climate change, dominant for the former, playing a subdued role for the latter.

"Resilient Design in Nuclear Energy: Critical Lessons from a
  Cross-Disciplinary Review of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Accident","  Nuclear energy has been gaining momentum recently as one of the solutions to tackle climate change. However, significant environmental and health-risk concerns remain associated with potential accidents. Despite significant preventive efforts, we must acknowledge that accidents may happen and, therefore, develop strategies and technologies for mitigating their consequences. In this paper, we review the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, synthesize the time series and accident progressions across relevant disciplines, including in-plant physics and engineering systems, operators' actions, emergency responses, meteorology, radionuclide release and transport, land contamination, and health impacts. In light of the latest observations and simulation studies, we identify three key factors that exacerbated the consequences of the accident: (1) the failure of Unit 2 containment venting, (2) the insufficient integration of radiation measurements and meteorology data in the evacuation strategy, and (3) the limited risk assessment and emergency preparedness. We propose new research and development directions to improve the resilience of nuclear power plants, including (1) meteorology-informed proactive venting, (2) machine learning-enabled adaptive evacuation zones, and (3) comprehensive risk-informed emergency planning while leveraging the experience from responses to other disasters.

A social license for nuclear technologies,"  Nuclear energy technologies have the potential to help mitigate climate change. However, these technologies face many challenges, including high costs, societal concern and opposition, and health, safety, environmental and proliferation risks. Many companies and academic research groups are pursuing advanced designs, both fission and fusion-based, to address both costs and these risks. This Chapter complements these efforts by analyzing how nuclear technologies can address societal concerns through the acquisition of a social license, a nebulous concept that represents ""society's consent"" and that has been used to facilitate and improve a wide range of publicly and privately funded projects and activities subject to a range of regulatory oversight, including large industrial facilities, controversial genetic engineering research, and environmental management. Suggestions for public engagement and consent-based siting, two aspects of a social license, have been made before. This chapter modernizes these suggestions by briefly reviewing the social license and engagement literature. The Chapter discusses, in the context of how to acquire a social license, the role of government regulation, the role of project proponents and government actors, and the role of four key principles, including engendering trust, transparency, meaningful public engagement, and protection of health, safety and the environment. Further, the Chapter uses the social license concept to explain why some nuclear waste repositories have succeeded while others languish and provides concrete recommendations for the deployment of new nuclear waste repositories and advanced power plants, both fission and fusion-based.

Energy Realpolitik: Towards a Sustainable Energy Strategy,"  A long-term strategy based on existing technological, ecological, economical, and geopolitical realities is urgently needed to develop a sustainable energy economy, which should be designed with adaptability to unpredicted changes in any of these aspects. While only a highly diverse energy portfolio and conservation can ultimately guarantee optimum sustainability, based on a comparison of current primary energy generation methods, it is argued that future energy strategy has to rely heavily on expanded coal and nuclear energy sectors. A comparison of relative potentials, merits and risks associated with fossil-fuel, renewable, and nuclear technologies suggests that the balance of technologies should be shifted in favor of new-generation, safe nuclear methods to produce electricity, while clean-coal plants should be assigned to transportation fuel. Novel nuclear technologies exploit fission of uranium and thorium as primary energy sources with fast-spectrum and transmutation (burner) reactors. A closed fuel cycle and waste transmutation resolve the strategic issues associated with nuclear power. Innovative reactor designs utilize spallation of heavy metals in subcritical accelerator driven systems or molten-salt reactors. Importation and reconstruction of technical expertise already lost and aversion of further erosion are preconditions to any successful energy strategy. Research opportunities to perfect innovative nuclear, coal, and renewable energy technologies should be pursued. ",
"Fast Uncertainty Quantification of Spent Nuclear Fuel with Neural
  Networks","  The accurate calculation and uncertainty quantification of the characteristics of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) play a crucial role in ensuring the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of nuclear energy production, waste management, and nuclear safeguards. State of the art physics-based models, while reliable, are computationally intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a surrogate modeling approach using neural networks (NN) to predict a number of SNF characteristics with reduced computational costs compared to physics-based models. An NN is trained using data generated from CASMO5 lattice calculations. The trained NN accurately predicts decay heat and nuclide concentrations of SNF, as a function of key input parameters, such as enrichment, burnup, cooling time between cycles, mean boron concentration and fuel temperature. The model is validated against physics-based decay heat simulations and measurements of different uranium oxide fuel assemblies from two different pressurized water reactors. In addition, the NN is used to perform sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. The results are in very good alignment to CASMO5, while the computational costs (taking into account the costs of generating training samples) are reduced by a factor of 10 or more. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs as surrogate models for fast characterization of SNF, providing a promising avenue for improving computational efficiency in assessing nuclear fuel behavior and associated risks.

"Non-Intrusive Uncertainty Quantification for U3Si2 and UO2 Fuels with
  SiC/SiC Cladding using BISON for Digital Twin-Enabling Technology","  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Committee (NRC) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) initiated a future-focused research project to assess the regulatory viability of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Digital Twins (DTs) for nuclear applications. Advanced accident tolerant fuel (ATF) is one of the priority focus areas of the DOE/ NRC. DTs have the potential to transform the nuclear energy sector in the coming years by incorporating risk-informed decision-making into the Accelerated Fuel Qualification (AFQ) process for ATF. A DT framework can offer game-changing yet practical and informed solutions to the complex problem of qualifying advanced ATFs. However, novel ATF technology suffers from a couple of challenges, such as (i) Data unavailability; (ii) Lack of data, missing data; and (iii) Model uncertainty. These challenges must be resolved to gain the trust in DT framework development. In addition, DT-enabling technologies consist of three major areas: (i) modeling and simulation (M&S), covering uncertainty quantification (UQ), sensitivity analysis (SA), data analytics through ML/AI, physics-based models, and data-informed modeling, (ii) Advanced sensors/instrumentation, and (iii) Data management. UQ and SA are important segments of DT-enabling technologies to ensure trustworthiness, which need to be implemented to meet the DT requirement. Considering the regulatory standpoint of the modeling and simulation (M&S) aspect of DT, UQ and SA are paramount to the success of DT framework in terms of multi-criteria and risk-informed decision-making. In this study, the adaptability of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) based UQ/SA in a non-intrusive method in BISON was investigated to ensure M&S aspects of the AFQ for ATF. This study introduces the ML-based UQ and SA methods while exhibiting actual applications to the finite element-based nuclear fuel performance code. ",
